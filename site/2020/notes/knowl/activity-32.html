<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Again, use the information in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table-commnetwork.html" title="Table 7.2.14: In-person interactions over the course of a weekend.">Table 7.2.14</a>.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Let's assume that maximizing the number of interactions will minimize the amount of time it takes for everyone to receive the message. To accomplish this, we want to find a minimal spanning tree for our graph. Use the elimination method of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-mwst-elimination.html" title="Example 7.2.12">Example 7.2.12</a> to find the minimal spanning tree. What is the total weight of the tree?</li>
<li>Now use Prim's algorithm to find the minimal spanning tree. Is the tree the same as before? If not, state what has changed. What is the total weight of the tree?</li>
<li>Looking at the two minimal trees, find the degree of each person <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">in the minimal trees</em>. Is it reasonable to assume that if the person in each tree with the highest degree receives the information first that this person will be the fastest way for everyone in the class to get the information? Why or why not? Compare your thoughts here to your group's response to Question 3 of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act-commnetwork1.html" title="Activity 7.2.3">Activity 7.2.3</a>.</li>
<li>Now suppose that instead of one of my classes, this network is the communication network for an organization of human traffickers. What could you conclude using the graph? Who should a law officer investigate to learn the most about the organization the quickest? Explain your reasoning.</li>
