<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Since most states abide by the winner-take-all rule, single states can swing the outcome of an election from one candidate to another.

The 2016 election was not as simple, as the only state that could have singlehandedly changed the outcome was Texas, and it was not terribly close.</p>
