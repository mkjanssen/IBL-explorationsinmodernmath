<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">It turns out that Webster's method can also violate quota, though this is much less likely. In fact, if Webster's method had been used in every apportionment from 1794 to 2012, it would not have violated quota once. As it happened, though, Webster's method was only used in 1842. Perhaps Congress was wary of continuing to use a method that could violate quota after 1822 and 1832.</p>
