<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In the electoral college, each state gets a number of votes equal to its Congressional representation, i.e., its House seats plus two (for the Senate). There are currently 435 House members and 100 senators; the District of Columbia also gets 3 electoral votes (to equal the smallest states), for a grand total of 538 electors. In order to win an electoral college vote, a candidate must earn more than half of the electoral votes; since half of 538 is 269, the first candidate to win 270 electoral votes or more is declared the winner. It is possible for no candidate to reach the required 270 vote threshold, in which case the House of Representatives votes for the winner (by state). This has happened twice in U.S. history: in 1800 and 1824. However, the strength of the two-party system, as well as the winner-take-all rule followed by 48 of the 50 states, makes this unlikely (though not impossible).</p>
