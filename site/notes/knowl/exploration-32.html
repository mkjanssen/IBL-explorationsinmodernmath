<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One of the most controversial presidential elections in U.S. history occurred in 2000. In the end, George W. Bush defeated Al Gore 271-266 in the electoral college, and the vote in Florida was particularly close. See <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table-2000-florida.html" title="Table 8.3.1: 2000 U.S. Presidential election in Florida">TableÂ 8.3.1</a>.</p>

<li>Suppose that some of the Browne voters (but none of the Nader voters) decided to switch their votes to their second choice, Gore. How many such voters would have needed to switch their votes in order to change the outcome of the election in Florida (and, consequently, nationwide)?</li>
<li>Suppose that some of the Nader voters (but none of the Browne voters) had decided to switch their votes to their second choice, either Gore or Bush (with 20%  of the switched vote going to Bush and 80% to Gore). How many such voters would have needed to switch their votes in order to change the outcome of the election?</li>
<li>In this election, Gore aligned on major issues much more closely with Browne and Nader than with Bush. Despite this, do you think Gore's supporters might have been well-served by running negative campaign ads in Florida attacking Browne or Nader? How might the arguments presented in such ads have differed from the arguments presented in ads that directly attacked Bush?</li>
