<li>Assuming that the voter turnout in each state and DC is exactly 60.2% of citizens of voting age, and that each voter cast a vote for either Clinton or Trump, construct a scenario in which Trump could have won the election while receiving less than 25% of the nationwide popular vote.</li>
<li>In your answer to the previous part, which states did you assume Trump would win? Why did you choose those states?</li>
<li>If you wanted to construct a winning coalition of states for Trump that contained the smallest number of popular votes, should you include more larger states or more smaller states? Give a convincing argument to justify your answer.</li>
<li>What assumptions did you make in order to construct your scenario for the first question? Were they reasonable? Why or why not?</li>
