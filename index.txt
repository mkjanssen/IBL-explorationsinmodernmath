Syllabus version 0.1

## Course Information

* **Course**: Math 149-01 (3 cr.)
* **Term**: Spring 2021
* **Instructor**: Dr. Mike Janssen, Associate Professor of Mathematics
* **Classroom**: CL 2241
* **Class time**: 1:00-1:50pm MWF
* **Office**: SB 1612
* **Student Hours**: [Make an appointment](https://calendly.com/mkjanssen/student-hours) or drop by
* **Course notes**: [https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/notes/](https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/notes/) | [PreTeXt source](https://github.com/mkjanssen/IBL-explorationsinmodernmath)
* **Course website**: [https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/](https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/)
* **Catalog Course Description**: This course is focused on exploring college-level mathematics relevant for all students, regardless of discipline. We will investigate modern mathematical topics including number theory, modeling, fractals, infinity, probability, making meaning from data, and decision-making. Mathematical thinking, reasoning, and pattern discovery will be particularly emphasized. A guided discovery approach will be utilized, and we will discuss how a Reformed perspective impacts our view of the quantitative world. **Prerequisite**: an ACT mathematics score of 22 or higher or satisfactory completion of one course from Mathematics 100, 108, 115.

### Required resources

* Access to the [course notes](https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/notes)
* One 3x3 Rubik's cube (any cube will do, but [here is an inexpensive recommendation](https://www.amazon.com/CuberSpeed-JiaoShi-Meilong-stickerless-Classroom/dp/B07QHQYQ9F/ref=sr_1_5_mod_primary_new?dchild=1&keywords=3x3+cubing+classroom&qid=1606835769&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=8-5))
* A copy of [_Mathematics for Human Flourishing_](https://www.francissu.com/flourishing), by Francis Su


### Learning Objectives

* Students will play with God’s mathematical creation by solving a Rubik’s cube and other mathematical puzzles. (CS)
* Students will explore the notion of mathematical truth, and assess its place in understanding God’s creation. (RO, CR)
* Students will apply mathematical thinking to articulate a vision for a more just society. (CD, CR)
* Students will explore the power and limitations of mathematics for modeling the physical creation. (CS, CR)
* Students will identify, analyze, and present on a piece of beauty in mathematics. (RO, CS)

### Assignments

The best way to learn mathematics is to _do_ mathematics, and so we will regularly engage in the following items of work to strengthen our mathematical muscles.


#### In-Class Explorations

The heart of this course is the in-class work. Our class meetings will typically start with a short (5-10 minutes) introduction to the main questions under consideration. You'll then work in groups of approximately 3 to explore the activities posted to the [course notes](notes/) for the day. We'll wrap up with discussions of whatever you found the most interesting, as well as some big-picture takeaways.

This mode of instruction is **highly interactive; it is therefore essential that you participate in class each day** (see also [Flexible Course Design](#flexible-design) below for COVID contingency plans). Group participation will be monitored, and groups will regularly share their thinking with the class. 


#### Weekly Checkpoints

On most Fridays on which we do not have a thematic checkpoint, we'll end class with a short _weekly checkpoint_ (approximately 5 points). The purpose of the weekly checkpoint is to get a sense of how well you're understanding the material we discussed that week. They also have space for you to ask questions about the class; points will be awarded for both questions asked and answered.

#### Thematic Checkpoints

At the conclusion of each theme (e.g., _Play_, _Truth_, etc), we'll have a larger thematic checkpoint. The standard format will be as a 50-point "exam", but there may be exceptions to this (such as the Play checkpoint, which will be a Rubik's cube solve). The thematic checkpoints will be held on:

* DATES TO GO HERE

#### Reading Reflections/Discussions

Along the way, we'll read Francis Su's _Mathematics for Human Flourishing_, and consider the ways in which the practice of mathematics can help us lead lives of _shalom_. DETAILS TO ADD: DUE DATES, CHAPTER BUNDLES, SHORT WRITTEN REFLECTIONS, AND CLASS DISCUSSIONS
