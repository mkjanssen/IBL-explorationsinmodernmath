		  <title>Introduction</title>
		  <p>
			In January 2017, Dr. Francis E. Su, president of the Mathematical Association of America, gave his retiring presidential address, <em><url href="https://mathyawp.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/mathematics-for-human-flourishing/">Mathematics for Human Flourishing</url></em><fn>In 2018, he gave an expanded version of this talk as a First Mondays address at Dordt College.</fn>. In this address and the subsequent book <xref ref="Su2020" />, Su describes ways that the practice of mathematics can help human beings cultivate virtues which in turn enable us live the good life. He identifies several desires that encourage the cultivation of virtue, among them <em>exploration</em>, <em>play</em>, <em>truth</em>, <em>justice</em>, and <em>beauty</em>.
		  </p>
  
		  <p>
			This book uses guided exploration to investigate mathematical topics that specifically meet those desires. We will explore the Rubik's cube and other puzzles and thus <em>play</em> with mathematics. We'll see how deductive reasoning can be used to argue for <em>truth</em>, while also exploring its limitations. <em>Justice</em> will be explored by application of mathematics to democracy and the networks used to exploit our fellow image-bearers. And we'll finish the semester with projects that explore <em>beauty</em> in mathematics.

		  <title>A Note to Students</title>
		  <p>
			This work was compiled with some strong opinions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The first is that, as with a sport, instrument, or nearly any other skill, you can't learn mathematics without doing mathematics. Thus, there are few worked-out examples in this book. We would rather spend a long time in productive struggle to understand an idea deeply than be spoon-fed solutions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The second is that most people's ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are far too narrow. Mathematics is not merely geometry, algebra, and calculus (maybe with a dash of statistics for good measure). Mathematics is a way of thinking; it's about abstraction, deductive reasoning, and problem-solving. This way of thinking can be applied in surprising places, and can lead to delight and wonder at the world God has made. We will explore some of these questions this semester.

		<title>Play</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				One of the fundamental human desires is for <em>play</em>.
				In recent years, ancient games and puzzles such as Go, Nim, and Chess have given way to a slew of <url href="http://boardgamegeek.com">new games</url>, many of which can be understood and analyzed with mathematical thinking.
			
				In this part, we explore play in the context of the classic Rubik's cube puzzle.
				Our exploration of the Rubik's cube is heavily inspired by the <url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org">Art of Mathematics</url> project.

					<title>Motivating Questions</title>
					<p>
					<statement>
						Here are some questions we'll consider.
						<ol>
							<li>Who are you? Why are we here, together, in this class?</li>
							<li>What does it mean to play? To explore? We'll answer both in our major disciplines and in the discipline of mathematics.</li>
							<li>What are some of the superficial qualities of a Rubik's cube? What do you notice? What do you wonder?</li>

				<p>
					Today we start with introductions to the course. Dr. Janssen introduced himself and gave an overview of the course (see the <url href="https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/">the syllabus</url> for more!), and then we worked on <xref ref="expl_intro" />.
				</p>
				</introduction>
			
				<exploration xml:id="expl_intro">
					<p>
						<statement>
							First, introduce yourself to the members of your group. Then, consider the questions:
							<ol>
								<li>What are the essential qualities of play? That is, what makes one activity <em>play</em>, and another not?</li> 
								<li>What does it mean to be <em>playful</em> in your own major disciplines?</li>
								<li>What does it mean to be an <em>explorer</em> in your major disciplines?</li>
								<li>What are you excited about this semester? Your answer can be from one of your classes or outside of your classes.</li>
							</ol>
							Write your answers in your notes. We'll discuss your responses before working on <xref ref="firstquestionsaboutthecube" />.
						</statement>
					</p>
					<!-- <solution>
						We only really had time to discuss the first two questions. There were some common themes.
						
						<ol>
							<li>Play: is enjoyable; is fair; will depend on the person; involves actively engaging with body/brain; is voluntary; can be strategic; is a leisure activity; is hands-on.</li>
							<li>In our major disciplines, playfulness: involves hands-on activities; creativity with lesson plans; uses manipulatives; allows us to play with/try on ideas (thought experiments); is social (involves relationship building); explore mathematical/physicals ideas; is a mindset; must engage the whole person; involves puzzles; etc.</li>
							<li>We didn't have time to talk about our answers to this question.</li>
							<li>Things we're excited about: getting into more of our major courses, continuing to learn, making new friends/growing together with old friends, and others.</li>
							
						</ol>
						One answer to question 1 that didn't come up is that an activity is often called play when there are no great stakes in the outcome. We can try to solve the Cube, play chess with our friends, or even play a basketball game, and in the end, it's just play. If it's competitive, it doesn't really matter whether we win or lose, and if it's a puzzle we're playing with of our own volition, the stakes are probably even lower.

					The Rubik's cube<fn>We'll call it the Cube for short.</fn> was invented in 1974 by Erno Rubik, a Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture. It won the <em>Spiel de Jahres</em> (the German game of the year) in 1980, and it became one of the best-selling toys of all time. It's a great place to begin our exploration of mathematical play.

						<p>
							Just by turning the sides of the Cube, there are over 43 quintillion different configurations possible. <aside>43,252,003,274,489,856,000 to be exact.</aside>
							This is a nigh unimaginably large number.
							Brainstorm as many ways as you can (at least two!) to make this number concrete. 
						</p>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
							A popular approach involved covering the earth with a carpet of 43 quintillion objects. The estimates were that 43 quintillion pennies would carpet the earth 86 times, while 43 quintillion Rubik's cubes would blanket the earth 275 times. Another group estimated that 43 quintillion seconds is over a trillion years.

						The little cubes which make up the Cube are often called <term>cubies</term>. The cubies located at the corners are imaginatively called <term>corner cubies</term>, the cubies located at the centers <term>center cubies</term>, and the others <term>edge cubies</term>.

						In this investigation we'll consider the corner cubies. Hold your Cube with the white center cubie facing up and the red center cubie facing you.

<image xml:id="moving-corner-cubies" width="50%" source="./images/moving_cubies.svg" />
				</statement>
				<solution>
					There are 8 corners, with three stickers each. Since all corners have three stickers, and other cubies have fewer stickers, we can't move a corner cubie to any location other than another corner. But we <em>can</em> move a given corner to any other corner.

				  <title>Question</title>
				  <p>
					  <statement>
						  How can you tell when a cubie is in the correct <em>location</em>? How can you tell when it is <em>oriented</em> correctly? Is there a difference?<fn>Does it depend on the cubie?</fn>
					  </statement>

				  </p>
				<solution>
					Since the centers don't move relative to one another, we can use the centers to tell us where a given cubie goes. For instance, the corner cubie at the corner of the white, red, and blue faces must have a white, red and blue sticker. It is properly oriented when the correct sticker is in each face.

				<introduction>
					  <p>
						  Today, we'll get up to speed on how far everyone has come in solving their white (top) faces and layers. 
						  We'll be particularly interested in how you talk about/describe your methods. 
						  Then we'll see how the Cubing community has taken to writing and notating methods for systematically describing the motion of the Cube.
					</p>
	
				</introduction>
				
				<principle>
					<p>
						Find a partner. Take turns describing verbally <em>and without pointing to your Cube</em> your method for moving a corner cubie into its proper position. Similarly, verbally describe your method for moving an edge cubie into its proper position.
					</p>
					<!-- <solution>
						<p>
							We identified a few strategies for moving corner cubies to the correct location. If the cubie in question was already in the correct layer and the only thing we cared about was putting it in the correct location, we could just turn the appropriate layer until it was in the correct position.
						</p>
						<p>
							If it wasn't in the correct layer, we can orient the Cube and perform a rotation or two so the correct position for the cubie is the top right and the cubie in question is in the bottom left position. We then turn the right layer toward us, rotate the bottom layer so that the correct cubie is now in the front bottom right, and then turn the right layer away from us so that it is now in the correct location.
						</p>
	
						<p>
							We can also guess and check. <m>\ddot\smile</m>
						</p>
	
					</solution> -->
	
				</principle>
	
				
				<principle>
					<statement>
						As you probably noticed, it is challenging to orally describe complex/technical ideas in much detail<aside>A former professor of mine often threw up her hands at the idea of doing "math in the air".</aside>.
						
						Is it easier to describe your cubie movements in writing? Why or why not?
					</statement>
				</principle>
				
				<definition>
					<p>
						When the Cube is oriented so the white side is up and the red side is facing you, as in <xref ref="fig-standard-orientation" />, we will say it is in <term>standard orientation</term>.
					</p>
				</definition>
				
				<figure xml:id="fig-standard-orientation">
				
					<caption>A cube in standard orientation.</caption>
	
					<image xml:id="cube-faces" width="50%" source="./images/cube_faces.svg" />
			</figure>
	
				<convention>
					<p>
						The standard algebraic notation for moving the faces of the Cube is as follows: <m>F, R, L, U, D</m>, and <m>B</m> refer to clockwise quarter-turns (<m>90^\circ</m> rotations) of the front, right, left, up, down, and back faces, respectively, <em>as you look at the face in question</em>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						On the other hand, a <m>-1</m> superscript indicates a counterclockwise turn <em>as you look at the face in question</em>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Finally, we can string moves together by writing them left to right, such as <m>R F U L D</m>. If we want to repeat a move, we use exponents in the usual way, such as <m>R F^2 U (LD)^3</m>.
					</p>
	
				</convention>
				
				<exploration>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Rather than refer to the faces of the Cube by their orientation, we could have referred to them by color. Compare and contrast the color naming scheme to the orientation naming scheme. What advantages/disadvantages do each present?
						</p>
	
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
							We had a few thoughts. First, not every Cube has the standard coloring that ours do.
							Second, some people are colorblind, so referring to the faces by color would not be helpful.
							In short, every Cube has six sides and an orientation when you hold it in front of you that makes it easy to identify the up, down, back, front, left, and right faces. So that is what the Cubing community has adopted.
						</p>
	
					</solution>

				<p>
					A final concept we'll explore today is that of <em>order</em>.

					<title>Motivating Questions</title>
					<p>
					<statement>
						Here are some questions we'll consider.
						<ol>
							<li>How can we describe the location of a cubie?</li>
							<li>Are cube moves commutative?</li>
							<li>What does Magic Cube Move <m>CR</m> do?</li>
						</ol>
					</statement>
					</p>
					
					</assemblage>
				
				<introduction>
					<p>
						In order to solve the Cube, we need to figure out how to move cubies in carefully controlled ways. Starting in this section, we'll introduce one move at a time and make sure we understand exactly what it does before moving on.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a warning, be aware that what follows might be occasionally frustrating. That's ok! As we saw last time, the order in which moves are executed does matter, so one mistake will throw everything off. You may want to designate one member of the group as the Cube turner, and let the others carefully track the moving cubies.
						
						
					</p>
	
				</introduction>
				
				
				<convention xml:id="cubie-notation">
					<p>
						We identify a cubie by the faces on which it sits, using lowercase letters, and regardless of how our Cube is oriented.
						So, for instance, the corner cubie on the upper, front, right face is identified by the notation <em>ufr</em>.
						The order in which the faces are specified does not matter.
					</p>
	
				</convention>
				
				<activity>
					<statement>
					<p>
						Consider the so-called <term>superflip</term> configuration below. <aside>In the superflip, every cubie is in the correct location, but the edges are flipped.</aside>
						
						<image xml:id="superflip" width="45%" source="./images/superflip.svg" />
					</p>
					<ol>					
						<li>Name the position of the edge cubie with an orange and blue facelet.</li>
						<li>What name would we give to the green center cubie in this configuration?</li>
						<li>Identify the colors of the cubie in the <m>\ell db</m> position.</li>
					</ol>
					</statement>
					<!-- <solution>
						<p>
							We first observed that we need three letters to identify corner cubies, two letters to identify edge cubies, and one to identify center cubies. 
							These numbers correspond to the number of facelets each type of cubie has.
							In practice, we won't have much reason to refer to center cubies by name, as the centers don't move relative to one another.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>This cubie is in the <m>fl</m> position.</li>
							<li>We could call this cubie <m>r</m>.</li>
							<li>The colors are red, blue, and yellow.</li>
						</ol>

				<investigation>
				<title>Cube Moves and the Commutative Property</title>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are arbitrary Cube moves. Is it the case that <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> must always commute? That is, is it true that <m>XY = YX</m> for all choices of Cube moves? If yes, explain why. If it's not always true, give an example. In that case, are there conditions you can put on <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> for which it is true?
				</p>		
				</statement>
				<!-- <solution>	
					<p>
						In general, if the faces we're rotating, say <m>R</m> and <m>D</m>, have any cubies in common, the order in which we rotate matters. In this example, <m>RD \ne DR</m>.
						However, if the faces have no cubies in common, i.e., they are opposite one another, the order they are rotated does not matter.
						So, e.g., <m>RL = LR</m>.
					</p>
				</solution> -->

					We now turn to a couple of "mathemagical" Cube moves.

		<title>Truth</title>
		
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Throughout scripture, Christians are exhorted in various ways and to various activities regarding <em>truth</em>.
				We are told that knowledge of "the truth" will "set [us] free"<fn>John 8:32</fn>, Christ calls Himself "the way, the truth, and the life"<fn>John 14:6</fn>, and says that his mission is to testify to the truth<fn>John 18:37; to which Pilate asks: "What is truth?"</fn>. Further, Paul exhorts believers to think on "whatever is true"<fn>Phil. 4:8</fn>.
				But what <em>is</em> truth? Can mathematics help us better apprehend and understand it?
			</p>

				<p>
					Mathematics is often thought of as one of the last bastions of objective truth.
					One widely accepted cultural norm is that if a statement is quantitative, or can be arrived at via a sequence of logical deductions, it is often considered "true", whereas statements that cannot be presented in such a way live in the realm of opinion. But what do mathematicians mean when they talk of a statement being "true"? The answer might surprise you.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In this unit, we'll explore inductive and deductive reasoning, as well as formal logic. We'll explore the shortcomings of mathematical thinking in addition to its strengths.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This chapter is heavily influenced by <em><url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/books/truth-reasoning-certainty-and-proof">Discovering the Art of Mathematics: Truth, Reasoning, Certainty, and Proof</url></em> by Fleron, Hotchkiss, Ecke, and von Renesse.
