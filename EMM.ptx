		  <title>Introduction</title>
		  <p>
			In January 2017, Dr. Francis E. Su, president of the Mathematical Association of America, gave his retiring presidential address, <em><url href="https://mathyawp.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/mathematics-for-human-flourishing/">Mathematics for Human Flourishing</url></em><fn>In 2018, he gave an expanded version of this talk as a First Mondays address at Dordt College.</fn>. In this address and the subsequent book <xref ref="Su2020" />, Su describes ways that the practice of mathematics can help human beings cultivate virtues which in turn enable us live the good life. He identifies several desires that encourage the cultivation of virtue, among them <em>exploration</em>, <em>play</em>, <em>truth</em>, <em>justice</em>, and <em>beauty</em>.
		  </p>
  
		  <p>
			This book uses guided exploration to investigate mathematical topics that specifically meet those desires. We will explore the Rubik's cube and other puzzles and thus <em>play</em> with mathematics. We'll see how deductive reasoning can be used to argue for <em>truth</em>, while also exploring its limitations. <em>Justice</em> will be explored by application of mathematics to democracy and the networks used to exploit our fellow image-bearers. And we'll finish the semester with projects that explore <em>beauty</em> in mathematics.

		  <title>A Note to Students</title>
		  <p>
			This work was compiled with some strong opinions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The first is that, as with a sport, instrument, or nearly any other skill, you can't learn mathematics without doing mathematics. Thus, there are few worked-out examples in this book. We would rather spend a long time in productive struggle to understand an idea deeply than be spoon-fed solutions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The second is that most people's ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are far too narrow. Mathematics is not merely geometry, algebra, and calculus (maybe with a dash of statistics for good measure). Mathematics is a way of thinking; it's about abstraction, deductive reasoning, and problem-solving. This way of thinking can be applied in surprising places, and can lead to delight and wonder at the world God has made. We will explore some of these questions this semester.

						<alert>Catalog Course Description:</alert>
						This course is focused on exploring college-level mathematics relevant for all students, regardless of discipline. We will investigate modern mathematical topics including number theory, modeling, fractals, infinity, probability, making meaning from data, and decision-making. Mathematical thinking, reasoning, and pattern discovery will be particularly emphasized. A guided discovery approach will be utilized, and we will discuss how a Reformed perspective impacts our view of the quantitative world. Prerequisite: an ACT mathematics score of 22 or higher or satisfactory completion of one course from Mathematics 100, 108, 115.

	<section>		
					<title>Questions about the course</title>
	 -->
			
					<question>
						<title>What is this course <em>about</em>?</title>				
						<p>
							Mathematics is about the numerical, spatial, and logical aspects of God's creation. However, most people have a view of the content and form of mathematics that is limited to their K-12 courses.
					
							In content, many view mathematics as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and maybe trigonometry, all pointing toward calculus. In form, many view mathematics as a discipline in which the questions all have one right answer, possibly only one correct path to a solution, with new ideas presented as if handed down from Mount Sinai.
					
							We'll see this semester that both of these ideas are flawed. Mathematics is really about a way of looking at a question, and reasoning toward a solution. It's a way of doing this, as Francis Su suggests, that helps meet basic human desires and can ultimately cultivate <em>shalom</em> in its practitioners.
						</p>
					</question>
			
					<question>
						<title>What are the course learning objectives?</title>			
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Students will play with God's mathematical creation by solving a Rubik's cube and other mathematical puzzles. (CS)</li>
									<li>Students will explore the notion of mathematical truth, and assess its place in understanding God's creation. (RO, CR)</li>
									<li>Students will apply mathematical thinking to articulate a vision for a more just society. (CD, CR)</li>
									<li>Students will identify, analyze, and present on beauty in mathematics. (RO, CS)</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
					</question>
				
					<question>
						<title>What will we be doing on March 23 (other than celebrating Dr. Janssen's birthday)? In other words, what is the course schedule?</title>
						<p>
							That's a really tough question. Given the exploratory/inquiry-oriented nature of the course, I can't really say what we'll be doing on a given day all that far ahead of time. However, I think it will look something like this:
					
							<ul>
								<li> Module 1 (Play): January 10-January 27</li>
								<li> Module 2 (Truth): January 29-February 24</li>
								<li> Module 3 (Justice I): February 26-April 3</li>
								<li> Module 4 (Justice II): April 6-May 1</li>
							</ul>
					
							Also, the notes and activities on this site will hopefully be a useful tool for seeing what is coming up, as well as what you miss when you (unfortunately) have to be absent.
						</p>
					</question>
			
					<question>
						<title>But what am <em>I</em> supposed to get out of this course?</title>
						<p>
							That depends! 
					
							On a superficial level, this course fulfills several requirements. If you haven't taken a quantitative reasoning course, this course fulfills that core requirement. Or maybe you are seeking a middle school math endorsement; this course is required for that.
					
							Regardless of why you are in this course, I have several hopes for you.
							<ul>
								<li>I hope you have fun! I think mathematics is delightful, and not as dry or boring as is often presented, and I hope you get to experience that this semester.</li>
								<li>I hope you experience both authentic, active struggle with new mathematical ideas and questions, as well as the immense satisfaction from working out a solution.</li>
								<li>I hope your ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are expanded. We can think mathematically about almost anything, from games and puzzles to philosophy, truth, justice, and beauty. We'll explore these ideas while also acknowledging their limitations.</li>
								<li>On a related note, I hope you ask lots of questions!</li>
								<li>Finally, I hope you see the practice of mathematics as a form of fulfilling the cultural mandate. Even when we work to solve the Rubik's cube, we are inquiring into God's creation, exploring the hidden order and potential built into the fabric of the cosmos by our almighty God.</li>
							</ul>

				<subsection>
					<title>Questions about the course structure</title>-->
		
		
				<question>
					<title>What will we do on a typical day?</title>			
					<p>
						Each day will be an exploration, in groups of 2-3, of a sequence of mathematical tasks. We'll typically start by wrapping up any loose ends from the previous day, then move on to the new tasks for the day. We'll take the last ten minutes or so to present our responses to the day's tasks and discuss where to go next.				
					</p>
				</question>	
			
				<question>
					<title>How can I get help in this class?</title>
					<p>
						Given the inquiry-oriented nature of the course, your main avenue for help is to ask questions of others in your groups. If your group is stuck, I'll be more than happy to start you in the right direction, but will do my best not to give any answers away.
					
						If you are unable to resolve your questions in class, I welcome student hours appointments in my office (SB 1608). I prefer that you <url href="https://profjanssen.youcanbook.me/">book an appointment ahead of time</url>, but this is not required. If my door is open, just walk in! If it's not, you may knock, but I may ask that you make an appointment for another time.

	<section>
					<title>How will we be assessed?</title>
	 -->


				
						<question>
							<title>What items of work will be assessed?</title>
							<p>
								As described elsewhere, the course will be broken into four modules, plus the final project.
								For each module, there will be:
						
									<ul>
										<li> some journal assignments</li>
										<li> group (in-class) work</li>
										<li> a module final assessment (MFA)</li>
									</ul>
								 The nature of the MFA will differ from module to module and authentically and summatively assess your mastery of that module's content. 
					
								In lieu of a final exam, you'll do a final project exploring some mathematical topic that you deem beautiful and present during our final exam slot, which is <alert>3:30pm on Wednesday, May 8</alert>.
							</p>
						</question>
						
							 					<question>
	 						<title>What are the journals about? When are they due?</title>
	 						
	 						<p>
	 							Each journal will look a little differently depending on our current topic. 
	 							Sometimes you may be asked to read a short article or book chapter and react to it.
	 							Other times you may be asked to solve a few puzzles and discuss the process by which you solved them.
	 							Still other journals may look even more different; you'll find out when you open them.
	 						</p>
	 						
	 						<p>
	 							You'll have at least a week to think about each journal. Journals are officially due some Fridays at 5pm. Unofficially, they may be turned in until midnight the next day. <alert>Journals are due:</alert>
	 							<ul>
	 								<li>January 17</li>
	 								<li>January 24</li>
	 								<li>January 31</li>
	 								<li>February 14</li>
	 								<li>February 28</li>
	 								<li>March 20</li>
	 								<li>March 27</li>
	 								<li>April 3</li>
	 								<li>April 17</li>
	 								<li>May 1</li>
	 							</ul>

	 						</p>
	 						
	 						<p>
	 							Journals will be graded pass/no pass based on your ability to follow the given prompts.
 							</p>



	 					</question>
				
				
						<question>
							<title>How will each item of work be assessed?</title>
							<p>
								Unlike "typical" college courses, there are no points or partial credit to be earned in this course. Instead, each item of work will come with its own <term>specifications</term> for completing the item at one of four potential levels, each of which is given an approximate interpretation below:
								<ul>
									<li><em>E</em>xceeds expectations: this work is submitted on time, is extremely well done, clearly communicated, and could function as the official class solution.</li>
									<li><em>M</em>eets expectations: this work is generally correct, but either contains some minor mathematical errors which do not detract from the overall solution, or contains some unclear/incomplete communication.</li>
									<li><em>R</em>evision needed: the work contains some significant errors and/or the guidelines for preparing and presenting the solution were not followed, but you seem to be on the right track toward a passing grade.</li>
									<li><em>N</em>ot assessable: the work was not turned in on time, is difficult to read, or contains significant enough flaws that you're probably better starting over.</li>
								</ul>
								Generally, E's and M's are considered <em>passing</em>, while R's and N's are not. Some assessments will be graded on a 2-level rubric (such as group presentations), some on a 3-level (such as the Rubik's cube quiz), and others on a 4-level (such as the other MFA's).
							</p>
						</question>
					
						<question>
							<title>If my work is graded on mastery, can I revise and resubmit to improve my grade?</title>
						
							<p>
								Generally yes, though some caveats are in order.
							</p>
						
							<ul>
								<li>Group work presentations will be graded on an M/N scale; if you have something productive to say, each member of your group will get an M, and if not, each will get an X. You may not revise presentations which are not assessable. There is no limit to the number of times your group can be selected to present, so you can accumulate the number of successful presentations in line with your goal by repeatedly volunteering to present.</li>
								<li>The journals will be graded on an M/R/N scale. You may cash in a token for either a 24-hour extension (and may stack tokens to obtain 48-hour extensions, etc.) or revise a journal which was assessed at an R or X in order to obtain an M.</li>
								<li>The Rubik's cube MFA can be attempted up to twice/week starting on January 27, without penalty, until you achieve the grade you are aiming for.</li>
								<li>Details on other MFAs are forthcoming, but you may use tokens to revise and resubmit each MFA.</li>
							</ul>
						
							<p>
							
							</p>
						</question>
					
						<question>
							<title>Wait, what are tokens? What are they good for?</title>
							
								Tokens are a fake currency which you can use to break the rules of the class. You'll start the semester with five (5) tokens. You <em>may</em> have the opportunity to earn more, but this is not guaranteed. Tokens left over at the end of the semester are absorbed into the spacetime continuum and do you no good.
							
								In general, you may use tokens to:
								<ul>
									<li>earn a 24-hour extension on assignments with due dates. Tokens may be stacked to earn 48-hour extensions, 72-hour extensions, etc.;</li>
									<li>revise a journal or MFA (other than the Rubik's cube MFA, which comes with two free attempts/week from January 27 until the last day of classes);</li>
									<li>do other things, as announced (and updated here).</li>
								</ul>
						</question>
					
				
						<question>
							<title>How will my final grade be computed?</title>
				
							<p>
								In general, your final grade will correspond to the highest row which has been <em>fully satisfied</em> in <xref ref="finalgradetable" />:

		<title>Play</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				One of the fundamental human desires is for <em>play</em>.
				In recent years, ancient games and puzzles such as Go, Nim, and Chess have given way to a slew of <url href="http://boardgamegeek.com">new games</url>, many of which can be understood and analyzed with mathematical thinking.
			
				In this part, we explore play in two contexts: the classic Rubik's cube puzzle, and the game of chess.
				Our exploration of the Rubik's cube is heavily inspired by the <url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org">Art of Mathematics</url> project.

								<li>What are the essential qualities of play? That is, what makes one activity <em>play</em>, and another not?</li> 
								<li>What does it mean to be <em>playful</em> in your own major disciplines?</li>
								<li>What does it mean to be an <em>explorer</em> in your major disciplines?</li>
								<li>What are you excited about this semester? Your answer can be from one of your classes or outside of your classes.</li>
							</ol>
							Write your answers on your whiteboards. We'll discuss your responses before working on <xref ref="firstquestionsaboutthecube" />.
						</statement>
					</p>
					<solution>
						We only really had time to discuss the first two questions. There were some common themes.
						
						<ol>
							<li>Play: is enjoyable; is fair; will depend on the person; involves actively engaging with body/brain; is voluntary; can be strategic; is a leisure activity; is hands-on.</li>
							<li>In our major disciplines, playfulness: involves hands-on activities; creativity with lesson plans; uses manipulatives; allows us to play with/try on ideas (thought experiments); is social (involves relationship building); explore mathematical/physicals ideas; is a mindset; must engage the whole person; involves puzzles; etc.</li>
							<li>We didn't have time to talk about our answers to this question.</li>
							<li>Things we're excited about: getting into more of our major courses, continuing to learn, making new friends/growing together with old friends, and others.</li>
							
						</ol>
						One answer to question 1 that didn't come up is that an activity is often called play when there are no great stakes in the outcome. We can try to solve the Cube, play chess with our friends, or even play a basketball game, and in the end, it's just play. If it's competitive, it doesn't really matter whether we win or lose, and if it's a puzzle we're playing with of our own volition, the stakes are probably even lower.

		  	<p>
					The Rubik's cube<fn>We'll call it the Cube for short.</fn> was invented in 1974 by Erno Rubik, a Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture. It won the <em>Spiel de Jahres</em> (the German game of the year) in 1980, and it became one of the best-selling toys of all time. It's a great place to begin our exploration of mathematical play. 
				</p>
				
				
				
			
			
				<investigation xml:id="firstquestionsaboutthecube">
					<statement>
						<p>
							In your groups, investigate your Cubes. What do you notice? What do you wonder? Make a list of as many observations and questions as you can, and write them on your shared whiteboard.
						</p>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
							We noticed several things: there are six sides, and six colors. It seems that the white center is opposite the yellow, the blue center is opposite the green, and the red center is opposite the orange.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The main thing we wondered is: why does this exist? Why did Erno Rubik invent it? One person suggested that, well, it's a puzzle. And like we talked about last time, humans have this innate desire for play and creativity that was placed there by God. While some people might find the Cube a fun puzzle to play with, others might prefer a different sort of puzzle or game.

							A popular approach involved covering the earth with a carpet of 43 quintillion objects. The estimates were that 43 quintillion pennies would carpet the earth 86 times, while 43 quintillion Rubik's cubes would blanket the earth 275 times. Another group estimated that 43 quintillion seconds is over a trillion years.

				<solution>
					Since the centers don't move relative to one another, we can use the centers to tell us where a given cubie goes.

		  		<title>Conclusion</title>
		  		
		  		<p>
		  			Today we investigated our Cubes and explored the various properties of the cubies of which the Cubes are composed. We saw that there are three types: centers, edges, and corners. Since the centers don't move relative to one another, we can use them to determine when a given cubie is in the correct location.
		  		</p>
		  		
		  		<p>
		  			Due to Dr. Janssen's travel, we won't meet again until Monday, January 20. Your goals for then are to spend at least six hours working to solve the white face several times so that you can articulate a strategy. Ideally, your strategy will be clear enough that you could hand it to a friend who knows nothing about the Cube and they could follow your instructions to solve it. If you accomplish this, try to do the same for the white layer. If you don't accomplish it, that's okay! We'll get there!

		  	<title>January 20, 2020: Algebraic Notation and Order</title>
		  	
		  	<introduction>
		  		<p>
			  		Today, we'll get up to speed on how far everyone has come in solving their white (top) faces and layers. 
			  		We'll be particularly interested in how you talk about/describe your methods. 
			  		Then we'll see how the Cubing community has taken to writing and notating methods for systematically describing the motion of the Cube.
				</p>

			</introduction>
			
			<principle>
				<p>
					Find a partner. Take turns describing verbally <em>and without pointing to your Cube</em> your method for moving a corner cubie into its proper position. Similarly, verbally describe your method for moving an edge cubie into its proper position.
				</p>
				<solution>
					<p>
						We identified a few strategies for moving corner cubies to the correct location. If the cubie in question was already in the correct layer and the only thing we cared about was putting it in the correct location, we could just turn the appropriate layer until it was in the correct position.
					</p>
					<p>
						If it wasn't in the correct layer, we can orient the Cube and perform a rotation or two so the correct position for the cubie is the top right and the cubie in question is in the bottom left position. We then turn the right layer toward us, rotate the bottom layer so that the correct cubie is now in the front bottom right, and then turn the right layer away from us so that it is now in the correct location.
					</p>

					<p>
						We can also guess and check. <m>\ddot\smile</m>
					</p>

				</solution>

			</principle>

			
			<principle>
				<statement>
					As you probably noticed, it is challenging to orally describe complex/technical ideas in much detail<aside>A former professor of mine often threw up her hands at the idea of doing "math in the air".</aside>.
					
					Is it easier to describe your cubie movements in writing? Why or why not?
				</statement>
			</principle>
			
			<definition>
				<p>
					When the Cube is oriented so the white side is up and the red side is facing you, as in <xref ref="fig-standard-orientation" />, we will say it is in <term>standard orientation</term>.
				</p>
			</definition>
			
			<figure xml:id="fig-standard-orientation">
			
				<caption>A cube in standard orientation.</caption>

				<image xml:id="cube-faces" width="50%" source="./images/cube_faces.svg" />
		</figure>

			<convention>
				<p>
					The standard algebraic notation for moving the faces of the Cube is as follows: <m>F, R, L, U, D</m>, and <m>B</m> refer to clockwise quarter-turns (<m>90^\circ</m> rotations) of the front, right, left, up, down, and back faces, respectively, <em>as you look at the face in question</em>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					On the other hand, a <m>-1</m> superscript indicates a counterclockwise turn <em>as you look at the face in question</em>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Finally, we can string moves together by writing them left to right, such as <m>R F U L D</m>. If we want to repeat a move, we use exponents in the usual way, such as <m>R F^2 U (LD)^3</m>.
				</p>

			</convention>
			
			<exploration>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Rather than refer to the faces of the Cube by their orientation, we could have referred to them by color. Compare and contrast the color naming scheme to the orientation naming scheme. What advantages/disadvantages do each present?
					</p>

				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						We had a few thoughts. First, not every Cube has the standard coloring that ours do.
						Second, some people are colorblind, so referring to the faces by color would not be helpful.
						In short, every Cube has six sides and an orientation when you hold it in front of you that makes it easy to identify the up, down, back, front, left, and right faces. So that is what the Cubing community has adopted.
					</p>

				</solution>


			</exploration>

			
			<p>
				A final concept we'll explore today is that of <em>order</em>.
			</p>

			
			<definition>
				<p>
					The <term>order</term> of a sequence of moves <m>M</m> is the least positive number of times <m>n</m> that <m>M</m> can be repeated before your Cube is back where it started. We write <m>| M | = n</m>.
				</p>

			</definition>

			<example>
				<p>
					The order of <m>R</m> is 4, since 4 quarter-turns will put my right face back where it started, and no smaller postive number of turns will.
				</p>
			</example>

			
			<exploration>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Some questions on algebraic notation and order.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>How do <m>R</m> and <m>L</m> differ? (Other than that they move different sides of the Cube, of course.)</li>
						<li>How are <m>R^3</m> and <m>R^{-1}</m> related?</li>
						<li>What is <m>|F^2|</m>?</li>
						<li>What is <m>|R D R^{-1} D^{-1}|</m>?</li>
					</ol>
					<aside>
	An algebraic expression of the form <m>XYX^{-1}Y^{-1}</m> is called a <term>commutator</term>. Commutators live deep in the realm of <em>abstract algebra</em>, and have applications as diverse as solving polynomial equations and understanding concepts in quantum mechanics.
	</aside>
				</statement>

				<solution>
					<ol>
						<li>Since the <m>R</m> and <m>L</m> faces mirror one another, a clockwise right turn pushes the right layer of the front face to the top, while a clockwise turn of the left face pushes the left layer of the front face to the bottom.</li>
						<li>They're the same in the sense that applying either one has the same effect on the cube.</li>
						<li>It's 2. We know that <m>F^2</m> turns the front face twice in the clockwise direction; if we repeat that move, we'll be back where we started.</li>
						<li>We saw that <m>|R D R^{-1} D^{-1}| = 6</m> by repeating the sequence of four moves over and over again until we got back to where we started. We had to do it 6 times before that was the case.</li>
					</ol>

				</solution>

			</exploration>

		
<conclusion>
	<title>Conclusion</title>
	<p>
		After a week away, we started exploring algebraic notation for describing our Cube moves.
		Notation is an incredibly powerful mathematical tool.
		In a few symbols, we can communicate a lot of information. This can be counterproductive if we are not careful to define what our notation means.
		We'll become more familiar with cubing notation as we explore some "magical" Cube moves next time.

			<title>January 22, 2020: Magic Cube Moves I</title>
			
			<introduction>
				<p>
					In order to solve the Cube, we need to figure out how to move cubies in carefully controlled ways. Starting in this section, we'll introduce one move at a time and make sure we understand exactly what it does before moving on.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a warning, be aware that what follows might be occasionally frustrating. That's ok! As we saw last time, the order in which moves are executed does matter, so one mistake will throw everything off. You may want to designate one member of the group as the Cube turner, and let the others carefully track the moving cubies.
					
					
				</p>

			</introduction>
			
			
			<convention xml:id="cubie-notation">
				<p>
					We identify a cubie by the faces on which it sits, using lowercase letters, and regardless of how our Cube is oriented.
					So, for instance, the corner cubie on the upper, front, right face is identified by the notation <em>ufr</em>.
					The order in which the faces are specified does not matter.
				</p>

			</convention>
			
			<activity>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the so-called <term>superflip</term> configuration below. <aside>In the superflip, every cubie is in the correct location, but the edges are flipped.</aside>
					
					<image xml:id="superflip" width="45%" source="./images/superflip.svg" />
				</p>
				<ol>					
					<li>Name the position of the edge cubie with an orange and blue facelet.</li>
					<li>What name would we give to the green center cubie in this configuration?</li>
					<li>Identify the colors of the cubie in the <m>\ell db</m> position.</li>
				</ol>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						We first observed that we need three letters to identify corner cubies, two letters to identify edge cubies, and one to identify center cubies. 
						These numbers correspond to the number of facelets each type of cubie has.
						In practice, we won't have much reason to refer to center cubies by name, as the centers don't move relative to one another.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>This cubie is in the <m>fl</m> position.</li>
						<li>We could call this cubie <m>r</m>.</li>
						<li>The colors are red, blue, and yellow.</li>
					</ol>

				</solution>
			</activity>
			

			
			<investigation>
			<title>Cube Moves and the Commutative Property</title>
			<statement>
			<p>
				Suppose <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are arbitrary Cube moves. Is it the case that <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> must always commute? That is, is it true that <m>XY = YX</m> for all choices of Cube moves? If yes, explain why. If it's not always true, give an example. In that case, are there conditions you can put on <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> for which it is true?
			</p>		
			</statement>
			<solution>	
				<p>
					In general, if the faces we're rotating, say <m>R</m> and <m>D</m>, have any cubies in common, the order in which we rotate matters. In this example, <m>RD \ne DR</m>.
					However, if the faces have no cubies in common, i.e., they are opposite one another, the order they are rotated does not matter.
					So, e.g., <m>RL = LR</m>.
				</p>

				We now turn to a couple of "mathemagical" Cube moves.
			</p>

			
			<heuristic xml:id="cube-move-cr">

				<p>
					We had barely enough time to start talking about this exploration when class ended.
					It was suggested that the effect of this move on the front face of the Cube is 
						<me>
							ufl \to dfr \to ufr \to ufl.
						</me>
					<em>Do we agree?</em>
				</p>

			</solution>

			</exploration>
			
			<activity>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Now that you have identified exactly what <xref ref="cube-move-cr" /> does, use it to solve as much of your Cube as it allows.
					</p>

				</statement>

			</activity>
			
			<conclusion>
				<title>Conclusion</title>
					<p>
						We started by settling on notation to use to identify cubie locations.
						Our convention is to use lowercase letters referring to the faces in which the cubie sits, so corners require three letters, edges two, and centers one.
					</p>
					<p>
						We then looked at <xref ref="cube-move-cr" />. After some trial and error, we think we determined that it moves three corners on the front face in a cyclical manner.
						Which three corners it moves, and in what order, was not entirely settled when class ended. We'll pick this question up next time.

			<title>January 24, 2020: Magic Cube Moves II</title>
			
			<introduction>
				<p>
					Last time, we saw two "magic" Cube moves that effect only certain cubies. We didn't get a chance to talk about the second one, so it was moved to today.
					We'll then explore two more given time.
				</p>

			</introduction>
			
			<exploration>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Last time, we explored <xref ref="cube-move-cr" />, but didn't quite finish <xref ref="expl-cr" />. We'll finish that as a class first before moving on to <xref ref="expl-co" />.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						We clarified that this move cycles three corners on the front face: <m>ufl \to ufr \to dfr \to ufl</m>.
						All other cubies are left alone, and the orientations of the cycled cubies remain unchanged.
						After some discussion, the name "Three Corner Tango" seemed to stick.
						 </p>

					Consider the following sequence of cube moves:

				<p>The cubies affected by this move are <m>ufr</m> and <m>dbl</m>.

			<solution>
				<p>
					This moves cycles three edge cubies clockwise on the up face:
					<me>
						uf \to ul \to ur \to uf.
					</me>
					Since it's a cycle of three cubies, it has order 3.
					Following our name for <xref ref="cube-move-cr" />, we suggested the name <term>Three Edge Tango</term>.
					We also observed that if you reverse the direction of the upper rotations, you move the same three cubies, but in counterclockwise fashion.
					That is, the move
					<me>
						M_R^2 U M_R^{-1} U^2 M_R U M_R^2
					</me>
					moves 
					<me>
						uf \to ur \to ul \to uf.
					</me>
				</p>

			</solution>

			</exploration>
			
			<conclusion>
				<p>
					We've investigated the three main cube moves: the Three Corner Tango (which cycles the position of three corners on the front face), the Three Edge Tango (which cycles the position of three edges on the up face), and the Corner Bulldog (which reorients two corners at opposite ends of the Cube).
					We're almost there! In fact, you can peek ahead at <xref ref="cube-move-eo" /> and try to solve your Cubes this weekend. But we'll spend the next two class periods working on mastering these moves and solving our Cubes using these moves.

		  <conclusion>
			<title>Conclusion</title>
			
			<p>
				Today we explored the last move we need to solve the Cube. 
				We also described a strategy for solving the Cube<fn>Note that when you complete your Rubik's Cube MFA, you can use whatever strategy you want, but you will be asked to demonstrate competence on two of the four moves we explored (randomly chosen at the time of the MFA).</fn>. 
				Our method of solving the Cube is based on the <em>corners-first</em> (CF) method, which is distinct from the layer-by-layer (LL) method which is often the first solving method people learn. The first solution to the Cube, by Erno Rubik himself, was corners-first, and the first world speed-cubing record (22.95 seconds) was done corners-first.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are advantages and disadvantages to all methods.
				Advantages to corners-first are:
				<ul>
					<li>The move sequences are generally shorter in CF</li>
					<li>There are just a few important move sequences to memorize</li>
					<li>You generally don't "break" your existing work and so can recover from mistakes more easily</li>
					<li>The solution can scale from a leisurely solve of a few minutes or more to quite fast solves</li>
				</ul>

		<title>Truth</title>
		
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Throughout scripture, Christians are exhorted in various ways and to various activities regarding <em>truth</em>.
				We are told that knowledge of "the truth" will "set [us] free"<fn>John 8:32</fn>, Christ calls Himself "the way, the truth, and the life"<fn>John 14:6</fn>, and says that his mission is to testify to the truth<fn>John 18:37; to which Pilate asks: "What is truth?"</fn>. Further, Paul exhorts believers to think on "whatever is true"<fn>Phil. 4:8</fn>.
				But what <em>is</em> truth? Can mathematics help us better apprehend and understand it?
			</p>

				<p>
					Mathematics is often thought of as one of the last bastions of objective truth.
					One widely accepted cultural norm is that if a statement is quantitative, or can be arrived at via a sequence of logical deductions, it is often considered "true", whereas statements that cannot be presented in such a way live in the realm of opinion. But what do mathematicians mean when they talk of a statement being "true"? The answer might surprise you.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In this unit, we'll explore inductive and deductive reasoning, as well as formal logic. We'll explore the shortcomings of mathematical thinking in addition to its strengths.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This chapter is heavily influenced by <em><url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/books/truth-reasoning-certainty-and-proof">Discovering the Art of Mathematics: Truth, Reasoning, Certainty, and Proof</url></em> by Fleron, Hotchkiss, Ecke, and von Renesse.

			<section>
				<title>January 31, 2020: What is Truth? / Inductive Reasoning</title>
			
				<introduction>
					
					<p>
						Today we'll attempt to define truth, and then explore inductive reasoning.
					</p>
				</introduction>
			
				<investigation>
					<statement>
						<p>
							What is truth? What is fact? How are the two concepts related? How are they different?
						</p>

					</statement>	
					
					<solution>
						<p>
							<em>Truth</em> refers to propositions which are correct and valid for all time, places, and people. It never changes. <em>Facts</em> refer to propositions supported by evidence. They are subject to change based on new evidence.
							There was some debate about the nature of truth relative to belief. 
							For instances, Christians believe that the historical person of Jesus is the Son of God. 
							Muslims do not. 
							Is this statement true for Christians but not for Muslims?
							Or is the proposition that the historical person of Jesus is the Son of God <em>true</em>, but Christians and Muslims have differing beliefs on its truth?
						</p>

					</solution>


				</investigation>

				<activity xml:id="act-whats-my-world">
					<title>What's my world?</title>
					<statement>
						<p>
							In the game <em>What's my World?</em>, one person thinks of a single law that defines a hypothetical world (e.g., ``My world does not contain things that start with the letter `C'.''). The other players attempt to guess this governing law by taking turns asking questions of the creator, such as ``Does your world contain dogs? Does it contain cats?'' and so on. When one of the guessers believe they can identify the governing law, they ask the creator.
						</p>
						<p>
							Play a few rounds of this game, taking turns in the role of creator. <em>Other than asking the creator directly</em>, how could you be certain that you had determined the law of the world?
						</p>
					</statement>
					
					<solution>
						<p>
							We played various rounds of this game, but the only way we identified that we could know <em>for certain</em> that we had guessed the governing law correctly is by asking the creator. We can amass evidence and develop facts and a theory based on those facts, but we can only know for certain by asking the creator directly.
						</p>

					</solution>


				</activity>
				
				
				
				<definition>
					<p>
						<term>Inductive reasoning</term> is the process of drawing general conclusions from particular instances.
					</p>
				</definition>
				
				<p>
					The work of the guesser in <xref ref="act-whats-my-world" /> is to employ inductive reasoning to determine the general law put in place by the creator.
					This is the scientific process at its best: looking at the creation its orderliness and our creatureliness to infer larger governing principles.
					If you have taken a statistics course, this is the type of reasoning employed therein. If we have time in this unit, we may explore some examples of statistical reasoning.
				</p>
				<p>
					But how does this work in mathematics?

				<exploration xml:id="expl-goldbach">
					<statement>
						<p>
							Consider the following equations.
						</p>
						<md>
							<mrow>6 \amp = 3 + 3</mrow>
							<mrow>8 \amp = 3 + 5</mrow>
							<mrow>10 \amp = 5 + 5</mrow>

						<ol>
							<li>The vertical ellipsis <m>\vdots</m> appearing below the four equations suggests that the equations form a pattern that continues. What do you think the next five equations are in this pattern?</li>
							<li>Your answer to the previous question may fit the data, but it may not be what we are ultimately looking for. Let's impose another rule: the number 9 is never allowed. Can you find a (possibly different) pattern that fits this new clue in addition to the existing data?</li>
							<li>What if we further restrict ourselves by outlawing the use of 15 and any even numbers? Can you find a pattern that fits these new clues in addition to the equations above? What are the next five equations in this case?</li>
						</ol>


					</statement>
					
					<solution>
						<p>
							A reasonable guess for the next five equations is:
						</p>
						<md>
							<mrow>14 \amp = 7+7</mrow>
							<mrow>16 \amp = 7+9</mrow>
							<mrow>18 \amp = 9+9</mrow>
							<mrow>20 \amp = 9+11</mrow>
							<mrow>22 \amp = 11+11</mrow>
						</md>
						<p>
							If we don't allow 9's, we could do:
						</p>

							<md>
							<mrow>14 \amp = 7+7</mrow>
							<mrow>16 \amp = 5+11</mrow>
							<mrow>18 \amp = 7+11</mrow>
							<mrow>20 \amp = 7+13</mrow>
							<mrow>22 \amp = 11+11</mrow>
						</md>
						<p>
							Since I didn't use 15, I don't have to change anything.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The pattern described by the equations suggests a famous mathematical conjecture due to Goldbach: that every even whole number greater than or equal to 6 can be written as the sum of two (possibly equal) primes.
							Mathematicians have gathered a <em>lot</em> of evidence for this conjecture<fn>It's been verified for the first 4 quintillion even integers (which still isn't as many integers as there are configurations of the Cube!).</fn>, but until we have a conclusive <em>proof</em>, we won't know for sure if the pattern continues.

							The main weakness of inductive reasoning is that no matter how many data points you gather for your theory, it is possible to find another data point which blows it all up.

							The strengths are that it's easy to get started. You just gather data and study it. More data generally indicates stronger evidence for your conclusions. It also applies in realms in which pure deduction via axioms does not work.

					Mathematicians tend to be most interested in determining when a given property <em>always</em> holds for whatever collection of objects it purports to describe.

				<title>February 3, 2020: Deductive Reasoning I: Reasoning from Axioms</title>
				
				<introduction>
					<p>
						We saw last time that inductive reasoning was the process of drawing general conclusions from (usually empirical, observational) evidence.
						When we have more/stronger evidence, we have more certainty in the correctness of our conclusions.
					</p>

				</introduction>
				
				
				
				<p>
					Mathematical reasoning is generally deductive<fn>Though we have our own <url href="https://ringswithinquiry.org/SubSec-WellOrdering.html">special version of induction.</url></fn> (defined momentarily), and begins with <term>axioms</term>, which are statements that should be self-evident and taken to be true.
				</p>
				
				<investigation>
					<statement>
					<p>
						The most famous set of axioms are Euclid's postulates for geometry, defined in <em><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid's_Elements">The Elements</url></em>, which not only shaped thousands of years of geometry, but solidified the deductive approach to doing and explaining mathematics that we will explore in this unit.
						At the beginning of Book I of <em>The Elements</em>, Euclid identified five postulates and five axioms.
					</p>
					<p>
						Euclid's <em>postulates</em> are:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.</li>
						<li>Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.</li>
						<li>Any circle can be described given a center and (radial) distance.</li>
						<li>All right angles are equal to one another.</li>
						<li>If a straight line intersecting two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on the side on which the angles are less than two right angles.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>
						Euclid's <em>axioms</em> (or <em>common notions</em>) are:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.</li>
						<li>If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.</li>
						<li>If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.</li>
						<li>Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.</li>
						<li>The whole is greater than the part.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>
						The desired qualities of a system of axioms are:
					</p>
						<ol>	
							<li><term>consistency</term>: we cannot deduce contradictory propositions, such as "God exists" and "God does not exist" from the same set of axioms</li>
							<li><term>simplicity</term>: we have as few axioms as possible, and they are no more complicated than they need to be</li>
							<li><term>completeness</term>: the system can answer every question we can think to ask</li>

					<solution>
						<p>
							Axioms are unproved, self-evident propositions on top of which logical deductions can be made, and entire fields of study rest.
							They should be as simple as possible; all except Euclid's fifth postulate (the parallel postulate) are considered quite straightforward.
							The parallel postulate has a fascinating history; it turns out be independent of the other postulates, and one can create new geometries (on the surface of a sphere, for instance), by rejecting it.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are lots of unproved assumptions that we make in life.
							Many Christian mathematicians make explicit that they view the authority of Scripture as an axiom; they can't use logic to conclusively deduce that Scripture is the only authority for Christian faith and life, but they <em>assume</em> it in order to draw conclusions <em>about</em> faith and life.

					The author Lewis Carroll loved logic puzzles (he was actually a mathematics professor!), and wrote many of them. Here is one, axiomatized for easy reference.

					<statement>
						<p>
							Consider the axioms:
						</p>

							<li>If a kitten loves fish, then it is teachable.</li>
							<li>Every kitten without a tail will play with a gorilla.</li>
							<li>All kittens with whiskers love fish.</li>

					Now, prove the theorems that follow using <xref ref="axiom-kittens" />.

				<theorem>
					<statement>
						<p>
							All kittens with whiskers are teachable.
						</p>
					</statement>
					<proof>
						<p>
							Suppose we have a kitten with whiskers. Let's call him Arthur. By <xref ref="axiom-kittens" /> #3, Arthur loves fish. Since Arthur loves fish, <xref ref="axiom-kittens" /> #1 implies that Arthur is teachable.

					<title>Conclusion</title>
					
					<p>
						After finishing our discussion of inductive reasoning, we began to examine deductive reasoning, which works by using logic to begin from axioms (unproved, obvious statements we take to be true), and reasoning to conclusions.
						The true statements in an axiomatic, deductive system are called theorems.
						We ran out of time to look at the other theorems of Lewis Carroll, so they have been moved to next time.

						Consider the axioms of Smullyan Island<fn>Named for American mathematician and logician, <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan">Raymond Smullyan</url>.</fn>:

						<p>
							If Gretchen were a knight, she would be lying when she said "We are both knaves." Thus, she is a knave.

				A hallmark of mathematical thinking and research is to abstract from a collection of examples to make a deeper structural conjecture, for which we then attempt to supply a deductive proof.
				As an example, consider <xref ref="expl-goldbach" />.
				We collected examples of a pattern (the equations) and suggested the conjecture that all even whole numbers greater than or equal to 6 can be written as the sum of two primes.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mathematicians began mathematize and formalize logic itself. Today we begin to explore these foundational issues. We'll start with some definitions.
			</p>

			
			<definition>
				<p>
					A <term>proposition</term> is a declarative sentence which is either true or false, but not both.
					An <term>elementary proposition</term> is a sentence with a subject and a verb, but no connectives (such as <em>and, or, not, if-then,</em> or <em>if-and-only-if</em>).
				</p>

			</definition>
			
			<activity xml:id="act-statements">
				<statement>
					<p>
						Determine which of the following are propositions (elementary or otherwise).
						If a given sentence is a statement, determine its truth value.
						If it isn't, explain why not.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Erik Hoekstra is the president of Dordt University.</li>
						<li>The square root of a whole number is always a whole number.</li>
						<li>The Green Bay Packers are the worst football team.</li>
						<li>Why is this class so much fun?</li>
						<li>This sentence is false.</li>
						<li>A group of crows is called a murder.</li>
						<li>Everyone likes cats.</li>
					</ol>

				</statement>
				
				<solution>
					<ol>
						<li>This is a true proposition.</li>
						<li>This is a false proposition. As an example, <m>\sqrt{21}</m> is not a whole number.</li>
						<li>This one is harder (though it's an easy "true" from your instructor). But it's likely either a false proposition (due to the Packers not having the worst record in the league) or not a proposition at all, as agreement with the sentence is a matter of subjective taste.</li>
						<li>This is an interrogative, not a declaration.</li>
						<li>This is a declarative sentence, but it's neither true nor false; it's a paradox.</li>
						<li>This is a true proposition! Who knew?</li>
						<li>This is a false proposition.</li>
					</ol>

				</solution>


			</activity>
			
			<p>
				Now that we have a sense for what a proposition is, we'll take old propositions and make new ones using logical connectives.
				In order to describe how the connectives work, mathematicians define the truth values of the new propositions <em>formally</em> in terms of the possible combinations of truth values from the constituent propositions.
				This gives us an abstract way of considering the truth values of propositions.

				The formalization of mathematical logic ramps up a bit when we consider conditional statements.

				Note that this is different than saying that <m>Q</m><fn>Often called the <em>consequent.</em></fn> is true.

					We have seen thus far a way of formalizing logic so that we can think about the truth of a statement purely syntactically (structurally) without regard for the semantic meaning of the statements under consideration.
					In the late 19th century, mathematicians developed what became known as <term>formal systems</term>, consisting of axioms, which were strings of symbols, such as
					<me>
						\exists B \forall C, (C\in B \Leftrightarrow C\subseteq A),
					</me>
					along with a <term>logical calculus</term>, which govern the rules of inference that can be used on the axioms to deduce new theorems.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Further, mathematicians had long assumed there were consistent foundational axioms for their discipline.
					Newly discovered paradoxes challenged this view.
				</p>
				<exploration>
					<title>Russell's Paradox</title>
					<p>
						In a certain town lives a barber who only cuts the hair of <em>all</em> people who do not cut their own hair.
						Who cuts the barber's hair?
					</p>
					<solution>
						<p>
							This is a paradox: if the barber cuts his own hair, we reach a contradiction, as he only cuts the hair of those who do not cut their own hair. On the other hand, if the barber does not cut his own hair, he does by definition.
						</p>
						<p>
							This sort of self-referential paradox is exactly the sort that we'll study later in this section that led to the foundational crisis referred to in the section title.
						</p>
					</solution>
				</exploration>
				
				<p>
					Two main schools of mathematical philosophy sprung up in the wake of these discoveries.
					The <term>formalists</term> argued that statements of mathematics and logic are really just about the rules and consequences for manipulating symbols and strings of letters.
					That is, mathematics does not have a subject matter at all--just empty symbols, which may be given an interpretation in particular situations and thus have meaning.
				</p>
				<p>
					The response came from the <term>intuitionists</term>.
					Intuitionism is an approach that consideres mathematics to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of any principles which we can reasonably claim exist in an objective reality.
					Thus, in some sense, mathematics is up to whoever is doing the mathematics.
					To the intuitionists, the formalists were reducing mathematics to a meaningless game with symbols.
				</p>
				
				<principle>

						Do you resonate more with a formalist approach to mathematics, or an intuitionist approach?
						Relatedly: do you believe mathematics is something humans invent, or something we discover in the creation?

					</p>
				</principle>


				<p>
					In 1900, at the second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, the esteemed mathematician David Hilbert posed 23 theretofore unanswered problems in mathematics that he thought were important to guide the development of mathematics in the 20th century.
					We've already seen one of them (the 8th): the Goldbach conjecture.
					Most of Hilbert's problems have been solved, but three are unresolved, two are thought to be too vague to ever get consensus on what a solution would look like, and one is the subject of much debate.
				</p>
				<p>					
					In an attempt to resolve the issues raised by paradoxes like Russell's Paradox, Hilbert posed this problem, the second on the list:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					But above all I wish to designate the following as the most important among the numerous questions which can be asked with regard to the axioms: To prove that they are not contradictory, that is, that a definite number of logical steps based upon them can never lead to contradictory results….
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>
					That is, Hilbert wanted mathematicians to prove that the axioms on which mathematics was founded did not lead to a contradiction.
					The resolution to this problem is surprising, and to begin to explore it, we will return to Smullyan Island.
					Recall <xref ref="axiom-smullyan" />.
				</p>
				
				<exploration>
					<statement>
						<p>
							While visiting Smullyan Island, we meet two natives, Corrie and Will.
							Will says, "Corrie is a knave."
							Corrie says, "Exactly one of us is a knight."
							What are Corrie and Will?
						</p>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
							We may begin by supposing Corrie is a knave<fn>Though we could assume either one is a knight or a knave.</fn>.
							In that case, her statement is false, and there must be 0 or 2 knights.
							But if Corrie is a knave, there cannot be 2 knights, so there must be 0 knights, in which case Will's statement is false.
							However, this leads us to the conclusion that Corrie is a knight, yet we began by assuming that she is a knave.
							</p>

							<p>
								This contradiction forces us to conclude that Corrie is a knight, and her statement implies that she is the only knight.
								Thus, Will is a knave.
							</p>

					</solution>

				</exploration>
				
				<exploration>
					<statement>
						<p>
							While visiting Smullyan Island, you meet three people: Abbie, Bart, and Cate.
							Abbie says, "Cate is a knave".
							Bart says, "None of us are knaves."
							Cate says, "Bart is a knight."
							What are Abbie, Bart, and Cate?
						</p>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
							Begin by supposing Abbie is a knave.
							Then Cate must be a knight, whereby Bart is a knight; but this cannot be, because it would force Bart's statement to be true, contradicting the assumption that Abbie is a knave.
							Therefore, Abbie is a knight.
							</p>
						<p>
							Since Abbie is a knight, Cate is a knave, whereby Bart must be a knave as well.
						</p>
					</solution>

					For the explorations that follow, recall that the only way in which the implication <m>P\Rightarrow Q</m> is false is if <m>P</m> is true but <m>Q</m> is false; see <xref ref="def-implications" /> and the ensuing discussion for more.
				</p>
				
				<exploration xml:id="expl-knavessay">
					<statement>
						<p>
							Consider the following questions about knaves on Smullyan Island.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Can a knave say, "If I am a knight, then there is gold on Smullyan Island?" Explain.</li>
							<li>Can a knave say, "If I am a knight, then <m>1+1=3</m>?" Explain.</li>
							<li>Can a knave say, "If I am a knight, then <m>Q</m>," for any statement <m>Q</m>? Explain.</li>
						</ol>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
							We had an in-depth discussion on this, and it all hinges on what it means for the implication <m>P\Rightarrow Q</m> to be true. Since a knave can only say false statements, the knave can only say things of the form <m>P \Rightarrow Q</m> when <m>P</m> is true but <m>Q</m> is false.
							Since the statement <m>P = \text{"I am a knight"}</m> is false, the knave cannot say anything of this form, regardless of the truth or falsity of <m>Q</m>.

						<p>
							The big take-away from this exploration is that knights cannot say anything of the form "If I am a knight, then <m>Q</m>" if <m>Q</m> is false. This puts us in row 2 of the truth table for <m>P\Rightarrow Q</m> defined in <xref ref="def-implications" />, which is the only way for <m>P\Rightarrow Q</m> to be false.

						</p>
					</statement>

					In order to draw appropriate conclusions, we will need to be outside the system, so we will consider a reasoner named Raymond as he interacts with natives on Smullyan Island.
					We will first deal with a Raymond who believes he is incapable of making a mistake; that is, if Raymond believes a particular statement, then, as far as he is concerned, the statement is really true.
					For example, if Raymond ever believes that a native is a knight, then because he thinks he is incapable of making mistakes, he concludes that the native really is a night and therefore that everything that person says is true.

		  				A normal, consistent, stable reasoner of type 1<fn>A reasoner is <term>type 1</term> if she believes all tautologies (propositions that can be established purely on the basis of truth tables for the logical connectives) and believes in <em>modus ponens</em>: whenever <m>P</m> and <m>P\Rightarrow Q</m> are true, <m>Q</m> is true.</fn> comes to the island and believes the rules of the island.
		  				She meets a native who says: "You will never believe that I am a knight". Then the reasoner's belief system is incomplete.
		  				That is, the reasoner will never believe that the native is a knight, and will never believe that the native is not a knight.

		  		Informally, this theorem states that any <em>sufficiently strong</em> consistent formal system contains undecidable statements.
		  		That is, there are sensible statements that one can make which cannot be proved from within the system.
		  		In that case, we may adopt the undecidable statement <em>or its negation</em> as an additional axiom without causing any contradiction.

		  	</p>
		  	
		  	<p>
		  		It may not surprise you to learn that there is a second incompleteness theorem, which we now state.

		  		Informally, Godel's Second Incompleteness Theorem states that no consistent formal system can prove its own consistency.
		  		We thus obtain limitations on the formal axiomatic approach to mathematics.
		  		Any consistent set of axioms and rules of inference strong enough to include arithmetic must contain undecidable statements.
		  		Furthermore, no sufficiently strong formal system can establish its own consistency!

						<introduction>
							<p>
								As you have hopefully seen thus far, this class is all about <em>mathematical thinking</em>, and its applications to realms of thought which we may not traditionally think of as mathematical.
								Specifically, we've applied mathematical thinking to <em>play</em> in the context of the Cube, <em>truth</em> in the context of deductive reasoning, and now <em>justice</em> in the context of voting and elections (and subsequently, human trafficking).
								Your final project will explore beauty in mathematics. More later.
							</p>

							<p>
								Our main task in this chapter is to explore the mathematics of <term>voting systems</term>, which refers to both the ways votes are cast in elections <em>and</em> the way those votes are used to determine a winner.
								We'll see in this section that while two candidate-systems are straightforward relative to other voting systems, they provide a fertile ground to introduce and study characteristics we desire in all systems.
							</p>

						</introduction>
						
						<p>
							We first want to determine how each system treats the voters and the candidates.
							A fair system should, in theory, treat each voter and each candidate equally.

							<statement>

									It's time for the citizens of Sudden Valley to elect a new mayor, and they have two choices: Michael Bluth, and his brother, Buster Bluth.

								<p>
									If <xref ref="act-twocand" /> seemed too easy, consider the following (likely alternative) suggestion.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Bluths' father, George, has been a long-time player in Sudden Valley politics. It's important that all the citizens vote, but the winner will be whomever George votes for, regardless of how the other votes come in.

								<p>
									Does a dictatorship treat all voters equally? Does it treat the candidates equally? Explain.

									Yes, all voters are treated equally. Each voter has the same amount of influence on the outcome.

							In our quest for a mathematically just voting system, we will find it helpful to define certain desirable qualities for a fair and just system to satisfy.
							When we say that a voting system satisfies a certain criterion, we mean that it <em>always</em> satisfies it; that is, it can never violate that criterion.
							We will refer to these important criteria as <term>fairness criteria</term>. We have already observed a few important criteria that we now formalize.

						The two-candidate voting system we haven't yet explored is probably the one that you actually suggested in <xref ref="act-twocand" />.
						Perhaps it is something like:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						Each voter should vote for the candidate they want to win the election.
						The votes are counted, and the candidate with the largest number of votes should be declared the winner.<aside>We'll worry about ties separately.</aside>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						This is known as <term>majority rule</term>.
					</p>

					
					<investigation>
						<statement>
							<p>
								Which of the three fairness criteria does majority rule satisfy? Give a clear and convincing explanation of your answers.
							</p>
						</statement>
						<solution>
							<p>
								All of them! It behaves much the same way as minority rule, except now it's helpful to get more votes.
							</p>

						</solution>

					</investigation>

					<p>
						In fact, for elections with two candidates, majority rule is the only system to satisfy all three fairness criteria.
					</p>
					
					<theorem xml:id="thm-may">
						<creator>K. May (1952)</creator>
						<statement>
							<p>
								In a two-candidate election with an odd number of voters, majority rule is the only voting system that is anonymous, neutral, and monotone and avoids the possibility of a tie.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</theorem>
					
					<conclusion>
						<p>
							Thus, for elections with two candidates, there is a clear just choice for a voting system subject to our adopted fairness criteria: majority rule.
							However, as we know, most elections don't have just two candidates, so we will next consider how to handle situations with more than two choices.
							We'll refine the existing fairness criteria to handle three or more candidates, and develop additional criteria due to surprising situations that can arise.

									<li>In this election, did any candidate receive a <em>majority</em> (more than half) of the popular votes cast in the state of Florida?</li>
									<li>If George W. Bush and Al Gore had been the only candidates on the ballot in Florida in 2000, do you think that Gore might have possibly received more popular votes than Bush in Florida?</li>
								</ol>
							</statement>
						</activity>
						
						<p>
							In fact, many political scientists believe that Ralph Nader was a <em>spoiler candidate</em> for Gore in 2000; that is, they believe that a large percentage of the Nader voters likely would have voted for Gore if Nader had not been on the ballot.
							Moreover, since Florida was the deciding factor in the election (we'll talk more about the electoral college later), the razor-thin margin of 537 votes (0.009% of the popular vote in Florida) swung the election from Gore to Bush.
							In this section, we'll explore the wrinkles introduced by additional candidates, and develop alternative systems for choosing winners of elections.
						</p>
						
						<definition>
							<p>
								A candidate in an election who receives more votes than any of the other candidates is said to receive a <term>plurality</term> of the votes cast.

							We adopt the following definitions.
						</p>
						
						<definition xml:id="def-majoritypluralityrule">
							<statement>
								<p>
									Consider an election with more than two candidates.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li><term>Majority rule</term> is the voting system that elects the candidate who receives more than half the votes, if such a candidate exists. If no such candidate exists, the election is declared a tie with no winner.</li>
									<li>The <term>plurality method</term> is the voting system that elects the candidate that receives the largest number of votes. The plurality method only produces a tie when two candidates receive exactly the same number of votes, and this number is more than any other candidate.</li>

									<li>If a candidate wins an election under the plurality method, would that candidate also be guaranteed to win under majority rule?</li>
								</ol>
							</statement>
						</principle>

						<p>
							The plurality method is familiar, and so likely seems quite fair.
							But let's consider the next exploration, this time from the 2016 Republican presidential primary process.
						</p>
						
						<exploration xml:id="expl-GOPprimary">
							<statement>
								<p>
									Twenty-one people filed paperwork with the U.S. Federal Election Commission as candidates for the 2016 Republication nomination for president.
									There were 31,183,841 votes cast in the Republican primaries nationwide in 2016.
								</p>

								<ol>
									<li>Donald Trump received 14,015,993 of these votes. Did he receive a majority of the votes cast in the Republican primaries?</li>
									<li>If the winner of the 2016 Republican nomination had been chosen by plurality from these 21 candidates, what is the smallest number of votes Trump could have received and still had a chance at winning the nomination? (Assume that the number of votes remains fixed at 31,183,841.)</li>
									<li>Under the same assumptions as Question 2, what is the maximum number of voters who could have preferred Trump the <em>least</em> among the 21 candidates in order for him to still have had a chance of winning the nomination?</li>
									<li>Using your answers to Questions 2 and 3, formulate a well-written criticism of the plurality method. You don't have to agree with your argument, but put yourself in the shoes of a critic and try to predict the type of argument that could be made.</li>
								</ol>
							</statement>
						</exploration>

						
						</subsection>
						
						<subsection>
							<title>A solution</title>
							
							<p>
								As we saw in <xref ref="expl-GOPprimary" />, when there are <m>N</m> candidates, it is possible for the vote to be split so thoroughly that one candidate can win with just over <m>1/N</m>-th of the vote.
								In this case, a majority of the voters will prefer someone other than the person who is ultimately elected.
								But the situation is even worse than that<mdash/>it's possible for the candidate who wins the plurality of the vote to be the <em>last</em> choice of a <em>majority</em> of voters, but still win!
								The main reason that the plurality method is susceptible to this is that it only takes a voter's first choice into account; there is no penalty for being a voter's last choice, and no benefit to being the voter's second choice.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								We will therefore explore methods of voting and fairness criteria that account for a full top-to-bottom ranking of candidates by voters, called a <term>preference order</term>.
								If there are three candidates in an election, say Michael, Lindsay, and Buster, and my preference order is that Michael is my top candidate, Buster my second choice, and Lindsay my third, we may write <m>M \succ B \succ L</m>, where the symbol <m>\succ</m> means "is preferred to".
							</p>
							
							<activity>
								<statement>
									<ol>
										<li>Consider a 3-candidate election for the presidency of the Bluth Company between Michael, Lindsay, and Buster. How many possible preference orders are there? In other words, in how many different ways could the voters rank them?</li>
										<li>Suppose their brother George enters the race, bringing the total number of candidates to 4. Now how many preference orders are possible now?</li>
									</ol>
								</statement>
							</activity>
							
							<p>
								Since our voters will be casting <term>preference ballots</term>, we need a different way of displaying the votes cast.

							<title>The Borda Count</title>
								
								<p>
									One very popular method for choosing the winner of a multi-candidate election is the Borda count.
								</p>
								
								<definition>
									<p>
										Consider an election with <m>N</m> candidates.
										The <term>Borda count</term> works as follows.
										Each voter submits a ballot that contains their entire preference order for all candidates in the election.
										For each ballot cast, points are awarded to each candidate according to the following rules:
									</p>
									<ul>										
										<li>A last-place vote is worth 1 point.</li>
										<li>A second-to-last-place vote is worth 2 points.</li>
										<li><m>\vdots</m></li>
										<li>A third-place vote is worth <m>N-2</m> points.</li>
										<li>A second-place vote is worth <m>N-1</m> points.</li>
										<li>A first-place vote is worth <m>N</m> points.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p>
										The candidate who accumulates the largest number of total points from all of the ballots is declared the winner, and the societal preference order is determined by listing the candidates in order of the number of points they received, largest to smallest.
										In the event that two or more candidates are tied with the largest number of points, they are all declared winners (or some suitable prearranged tiebreaking procedure is used).

							<statement>
								<p>
									Consider the following proposed voting system, using <xref ref="table-bcprez" /> as the preference schedule.
								</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Step 1: First, we'll ask voters to choose between George and Lindsay. Since this is a two-candidate election, we'll use majority rule to decide the winner.</li>
									<li>Step 2: Next, we'll ask the voters to choose between Buster and the winner from Step 1, again using majority rule to decide the winner.</li>
									<li>Step 3: Finally, we'll ask the voters to choose between Michael and the winner from Step 2. Whoever wins this third head-to-head contest will be declared the overall winner.</li>

									<li>Under this method, who wins the presidency of the Bluth Company?</li>

									<li>Is there a Condorcet winner and/or loser in this election? Explain.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<p>
									The method described above is known as <term>sequential pairwise voting</term>. What strikes you as being different or unusual about it, especially compared to the plurality and Borda count systems we've already explored?
								</p>


							</statement>
						</exploration>
						
						<p>
							We'll finish this section by exploring sequential pairwise voting and the CWC/CLC a bit more.
						</p>
						
						<investigation>
							<statement>
								<ol>
									<li>Could a Condorcet winner ever lose a head-to-head contest with another candidate? Why or why not?</li>
									<li>What does your answer to Question 1 allow you to conclude about sequential pairwise voting and the CWC?</li>
									<li>Does sequential pairwise voting satisfy the CLC? If so, explain why. Otherwise, give an example of a preference schedule for which sequential pairwise voting could elect a Condorcet loser.</li>
								</ol>
							</statement>
						</investigation>
						
						<p>
							As we have just seen, SPV satisfies the CWC. This means that it will always elect a Condorcet winner if one exists.
							However, when a Condorcet winner does not exist, as is the case in the Bluth Company presidential election, strange things can happen.
						</p>
						<p>
							After the actual preference schedule, the biggest factor deciding the outcome of SPV is the order in which the candidates face off.
							This order is called the <term>agenda</term>, and is usually specified by listing the candidates in the order into which they are to be introduced to the comparisons.
							In <xref ref="expl-spv" />, the agenda was G, L, B, M.
						</p>
						
						<investigation>
							<statement>
							<p>Consider the familiar preference schedule given in <xref ref="table-bcprez" />.</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Who would win the Bluth Company presidency using SPV with the agenda B, G, L, M?</li>
									<li>Find a sequential pairwise voting agenda for which Buster would win the presidency.</li>
									<li>Find a sequential pairwise voting agenda for which George would win the presidency.</li>
								</ol>
							</statement>
						</investigation>

						<p>
							We thus see that when there is no Condorcet winner, the agenda can play an outsize role in the outcome of an election decided by sequential pairwise voting.
							Since the order in which the candidates are presented seems to matter, it's reasonable to guess that SPV violates the neutrality criterion, which we confirm in the next exploration.

						<title>March 2, 2020: Elections with Three or More Candidates III</title>
						
						<p>
							In this section, we'll examine one last (new) voting system, called <term>instant runoff voting</term> (IRV) or <term>ranked choice voting</term> (RCV). <aside>The nonpartisan election advocacy group, FairVote, refers to this system as RCV. I prefer calling the system <em>instant runoff</em>; the non-plurality systems we've looked at for three or more candidates all involve ranking candidates, so I find the term too general.</aside>
							This system was proposed in the mid-1800s by Thomas Hare, and has slowly grown in popularity.
							Other than plurality, it is likely the most widely used system for choosing elected officials in the U.S.
							For example, the <url href="http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/rcv/index.htm">City of Minneapolis</url> uses IRV for its city-wide elections, and <url href="http://www.rcvmaine.com">Maine uses it for all state-wide elections</url>, including, for the first time in 2020, for the <url href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/maine-ranked-choice-voting-2020_n_5d72ca74e4b06451356df0f3">general election for president</url>.
						</p>

						<definition>
							<p>
								The instant runoff voting (IRV) system works as follows.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Each voter in the election submits their entire preference order.</li>
								<li>The candidate (or candidates, in the case of a tie) with the fewest first-place votes is eliminated from each voter's preference order, and the remaining candidates are moved up, yielding a new preference schedule.</li>
								<li>Step 2 is repeated until a single candidate remains. That candidate is declared the winner.</li>

							There is one more important fairness criterion we'll discuss.
							It's more subtle than some of the others, so we'll present a few versions of it.
							In short, what it says is that we want the societal preference between two candidates to depend <em>only on</em> the voters' preferences <em>between those two candidates.</em>
						</p>

						<definition>
							<p>
								If a voting system has the property that the societal preference between any two candidates depends only on the voters' preferences between those two candidates, then the system is said to satisfy the <term>independence of irrelevant alternatives</term> criterion (IIA).
							</p>
							<p>
								Put another way, a voting system satisfies IIA if some or all of the voters in an election change their preference ballots but no voter changes their preference between two candidates <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, then the societal preference between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must also remain unchanged.
							</p>
						</definition>
						
						<p>
							IAA is often interpreted as saying that if a candidate (<m>A</m>) would win an election, and a new candidate (<m>B</m>) were added to the ballot, then either <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> should win the election.
							A further delightful illustration of a violation of IIA is attributed to <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Morgenbesser">Sidney Morgenbesser</url>:
							</p>

							<blockquote>
							After finishing dinner, Sidney Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress tells him he has two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie. After a few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at which point Morgenbesser says "In that case I'll have the blueberry pie."
							</blockquote>

								Let's consider our current systems and IIA.

									<ol>
										<li>	Does plurality satisfy IIA? Why or why not?</li>
										<li>	Does the Borda count satisfy IIA? Why or why not?</li>
										<li>	Does SPV satisfy IIA? Why or why not?</li>
										<li>	Does IRV satisfy IIA? Why or why not?</li>
									</ol>
								</statement>
							</investigation>



						<p>
							At this point, you may be wondering which voting system is best. We saw a decisive answer if our election has only two candidates (the familiar <em>majority rule</em>), but when the election has more than two candidates, things have gotten complicated. Plurality, majority rule, the Borda count, SPV, and IRV all fail to satisfy at least one of our criteria.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							In 1951, economist <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow">Kenneth Arrow</url> proved the following landmark result. It states that our quest is hopeless! There is no fairest voting system.
						</p>
						
						
						<assemblage>
		  		<title>Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</title>
		  			
		  			<p>
		  				In an election with more than two candidates, it is impossible for a voting system to satisfy monotonicity, neutrality, anonymity, IIA, the majority criterion, and the CWC. <aside>Technically, we also need to assume that the votes matter (not imposed rule), and that there is no dictator.</aside>
					</p>
		  	</assemblage>
		  	
		  		<principle>
		  			<p>
		  				There is an ongoing debate about whether voting systems other than plurality are truly "democratic".
		  				For instance, lawmakers in Maine have repeatedly attempted to overturn the implementation of IRV for statewide elections, despite it passing on a statewide ballot initiative; see the "Timeline of Ranked Choice Voting in Maine" at the bottom of <url href="http://www.rcvmaine.com">this page</url>.
		  			</p>
					<p>
						What do you think? Regardless of which system you choose, what do you think of systems that take voter preferences beyond their first choice into account?
						What effect(s) do you think it might have on elections? On campaigning?
						Are there any other advantages or disadvantages you'd like to raise?

				<title>Modeling with Discrete Dynamical Systems</title>
					<section>
						<title>March 23-27: Intro to Discrete Dynamical Systems</title>
						
						<p>
							And now for something completely different. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							In the <xref ref="Sec-Introduction">Introduction</xref> to this book, I cited Francis Su's retiring MAA presidential address, <em>Mathematics for Human Flourishing</em>.
							In his address, Su argues that the practice of mathematics can cultivate virtues that help humans live lives of fullness and <em>shalom</em>.
							We've explored the ways in which mathematics enables us to play, discern truth, and to evaluate the fairness and justice of systems of voting.
							We may yet return to the ways in which mathematics is being currently used to argue for justice in our democracy, but first I want to explore the ways in which the <em>power</em> of mathematics can be brought to bear to help us understand our current global health crisis.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							As Su writes in his follow-up book <xref ref="Su2020" />, <em>power</em> "often sounds like a bad word," especially when applied to humans.
							Yet Su, himself a Christian, means power in the sense in which Andy Crouch defines it in his book, <url href="https://www.ivpress.com/playing-god"><em>Playing God: Redeeming the Gift of Power</em></url>:
						</p>
						
						<blockquote>
							Power is the ability to make something of the world...the ability to participate in that stuff-making, sense-making process that is the most distinctive thing that human beings do.
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>
							In this unit, we will focus particularly on the <em>sense-making</em> component of power and ask: how do mathematical explorers make sense of the physical creation via mathematics?
							We will explore some increasingly advanced discrete mathematical models, with the ultimate goal of understanding a basic model of how infectious disease spreads through a population.
							Let's start with some definitions and notation.
						</p>
						
						
						
						
						<definition xml:id="def-dynamical-system">
							<p>
								A <term>dynamical system</term> refers to any fixed mathematical rule which describes how a system changes over time.
								A <term>discrete</term> dynamical system changes at fixed intervals in time (e.g., each hour), and does not change between the fixed points in time (e.g., a system that changes each hour will view the changing quantity as static between the hours of 1:00pm and 2:00pm).
							</p>

						</definition>
						
						<p>
							There are two main types of dynamical systems: discrete and continuous.
							The study of continuous dynamical systems is the domain of calculus and its related disciplines (e.g., differential equations, aka DiffEq's).
							Continuous dynamical systems treat time as infinitely divisible; discrete dynamical systems do not.
							Let's look at an example.
						</p>
						
						<example xml:id="example-recursive">
						
							<p>
							
								Joris is a collector of board games.
								His collection currently has 37 games, and each year he budgets enough to acquire 8 new games.
								We'll use the notation <m>G_t</m> to describe how many games Joris has in year <m>t</m>, where we consider <m>G_0</m> (that is, <m>t=0</m>) to be the number of games he currently has.
								Thus, <m>G_0 = 37</m>.
								We would also expect <m>G_1 = 37 + 8 = 45</m>, and <m>G_2 = 45 + 8 = 53</m>.
								We say that <m>37, 45, 53\ldots</m> are the first three <term>terms</term> of the dynamical system.
							</p>
							<p>
								This way of describing the number of games Joris has is known as a <term>recursive</term> description, where each term depends on previous terms.
								That is, the recursive description is given by the formula
									<men xml:id="eq-recursive-games">
										G_{t+1} = G_t + 8, t \ge 1.
									</men>
							</p>
							

						</example>
						
						<activity xml:id="act-games">
							<statement>
								<p>
								A recursive definition is nice, because it is reasonably intuitive and fits with our usual understanding of how things change over time: they start from where they are now, and then change a little.
								But perhaps we'd like to know how long it will take Joris to accumulate 500 games <aside><url href="https://omahamagazine.com/articles/game-on/">People do this</url>, I swear.</aside>
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Clearly describe in 2-3 sentences <em>a process</em> for using the recursive definition in <xref ref="example-recursive" /> that would allow you to determine how many years it would take Joris to accumulate 500 board games. Please do not use this process to answer the question!</li>
									<li>In 2-3 sentences, describe the disadvantage in the process you used in Question 1 for finding how long it would take Joris to accumulate 500 games.</li>
									<li>What we want is a <term>explicit formula</term> for <m>G_t</m>. That is, we want a formula that allows us to plug in a value for <m>t</m> that will give us the number of games <m>G_t</m> that Joris has in year <m>t</m> without having to know any of the previous terms in the sequence. Find such a formula, and compute the first three terms to convince your group that your formula produces the same sequence as <xref ref="eq-recursive-games" />.</li>
								</ol>
							</statement>
							<solution>
								<ol>
									<li>Just using the recursive formula provided in <xerf ref="eq-recursive-games" />, we could find the number of years it would take Joris to accumulate 500 board games by generating the terms of the sequence and seeing when it passes 500. We would do this by first finding <m>G_1</m>, then <m>G_1</m> to find <m>G_2</m>, then using <m>G_2</m> to find <m>G_3</m>, etc.</li>
									<li>This is highly inefficient! In order to know, e.g., <m>G_{500}</m>, you would need to compute <em>all</em> preceding terms.</li>
									<li>An explicit formula is given by <m>G_t = 37 + 8t</m>. Observe that <m>G_1 = 37 + 8\cdot 1 = 45</m>, <m>G_2 = 37 + 8\cdot 2 = 37 + 16 = 53</m>, and <m>G_3 = 38 + 8\cdot 3 = 61</m>.</li>
								</ol>

							</solution>

						</activity>
						
						<p>
							The dynamical system described in <xref ref="act-games" /> is known as a <term>linear</term> system.
							This is because, like a line, it grows at a constant rate.
							Linear growth is extremely useful because it is straightforward to understand and apply.
							However, it has its shortcomings as well.

						<activity xml:id="act-linear-growth">

						<p>
							Populations of people and animals do not grow linearly. Instead, they usually grow by a percentage of the whatever the current population is.
							So, if that percentage is, say, 10%, and the current population of a group of fish in a pond is 1000, this model predicts a population of <m>1000 + 10\%\cdot 1000 = 1000 + 100 = 1100</m> fish for next year.
						</p>
						<p>
							In symbols, if <m>P_t</m> represents the number of fish <m>t</m> years from now, then <m>P_0 = 1000</m>, <m>P_1 = P_0 + 0.1\cdot P_0 = (1+0.1)P_0 = 1.1 P_0</m>.

						<title>March 30-April 3, Discrete Dynamical Systems II: Predator/Prey and SIR</title>
						
						
						
						<p>
							This week, we will be diving further into exploring how discrete dynamical models give us the power to understand and make predictions about the Creation. 
							We'll explore a basic predator/prey model and see how even relatively simple models of predator/prey interactions can behave qualitatively similarly to what we observe in the physical world.
							Then, we will explore a basic compartmental epidemiological model. 
							We will make explicit connections to the ongoing efforts of public health officials and epidemiologists to "flatten the curve" regarding the spread of COVID-19.
						</p>
						
						<subsection>
							<title>A discrete predator-prey model</title>
						
						<p>
							We begin with a classic predator-prey model adapted from the <url href="https://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/amwiki/index.php/Predator_prey">Feedback Systems Wiki</url> at Caltech.
							For historical reasons, we let <m>L_t</m> be the size of a population of Canadian lynxes in year <m>t</m> and <m>H_t</m> be the size of a population of snowshoe hares, the lynx's primary prey. <aside>Of course, we can carry out the following analysis using any predator/prey pair.</aside>
						</p>
						
						<definition xml:id="def-lotkavolterra">
							<p>
								Let <m>H_0</m> be the initial population of hares, and <m>L_0</m> the initial population of lynxes.
								For <m>t\ge 1</m>, the <term>discrete Lotka-Volterra model</term> for the lynx/hare population is given by:
							</p>
							<md>
								<mrow>H_{t+1} \amp = H_t + b(u) H_t - a L_t H_t</mrow>
								<mrow>L_{t+1} \amp = L_t + c L_t H_t - d L_t,</mrow>
							</md>
							<p>
								where <m>b</m> is the hare birth rate per unit time as a function of the food supply <m>u</m>, <m>d</m> is the lynx mortality rate, and <m>a</m> and <m>c</m> are interaction coefficients.
							</p>

							One might reasonably wonder how such a simple model does in making predictions about the long-term dynamics of these populations.
							The answer is: surprisingly well!
							In <xref ref="fig-harelynxdata" />, observe the actual collected data on hare and lynx populations over 90 years, from 1845 to 1935.
							In <xref ref="fig-harelynxmodel" />, we see dynamics predicted by the model.
							Note the same cyclical patterns of an increase in the hare population followed by an increase in the lynx population, which in turn causes a decrease in the hare population, etc.

						To be clear, the purpose of the model is not to make absolutely certain predictions about the precise numbers of hares and lynxes present in the Canadian wilderness.
						Instead, we want to understand the broad dynamics of how the populations change relative to one another.
						Mathematical ecologists can then use these models to understand how small changes in the parameters (say, an increase in the rate of predation) affect the broader dynamics of the ecological system.

						<title>The discrete SIR epidemiological model</title>
						
						
						<p>
							We now arrive at the main focus of this two-week unit: a basic mathematical model for the spread of an infectious disease.
							We'll first present the model itself and examine its features and assumptions.
							As was the case with the predator-prey model, we'll see that while it does make simplifying assumptions, it still allows us to analyze the broader dynamics of the disease transmission.
							We'll then look at ways of reducing the rate of infection, including the so-called "flattening the curve" method.
						</p>
						<p>
							We begin with the model.
							It is known as a <em>compartmental model</em>, as it divides the population into compartments and assumes that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics (at least as far as the transmission of the disease is concerned).
							We'll look at the simplest such model, the discrete SIR model.
							Many more complex models are built on the SIR model.
						</p>

						
						<definition>
							<p>
								Consider a population of <m>N</m> people through which a disease is spreading.
								For some discrete time <m>t \ge 0</m>, let <m>S_t</m> denote the number of individuals <em>susceptible</em> to the disease, <m>I_t</m> the number of individuals <em>infected</em> with the disease, and <m>R_t</m> the number of individuals who have <em>recovered</em> from the disease.
								We assume that that people move through the compartments as follows:
							</p>
							
								<men xml:id="eq-compartments">
									S \to I \to R.
								</men>
							
							<p>

								For <m>t\ge 1</m>, the model is given by the following equations.
							</p>
							<md>
								<mrow>N \amp = S_t + I_t + R_t</mrow>
								<mrow>S_{t+1} \amp = S_t -b S_t I_t</mrow>
								<mrow>I_{t+1} \amp = I_t + b S_t I_t - a I_t</mrow>
								<mrow>R_{t+1} \amp = R_t + a I_t.</mrow>
							</md>
							<p>
								The constant <m>a</m> is known as the <em>recovery rate</em> parameter, which roughly describes how fast someone moves from the infected compartment to the recovered compartment. The constant <m>b</m> is known as the <em>infection rate</em>, and roughly describes how fast someone moves from the susceptible compartment to the infected compartment.

							If you've been reading the news around COVID-19, you may have seen reference to a quantity called <m>r_0</m>. <aside>Read "R-naught" or "R-zero".</aside>
							This is known as the <term>basic reproduction number</term>, and is the expected number of new infections <em>directly generated</em> by a single case.
							So, if I were to get COVID-19, <m>r_0</m> would be the expected number of people I would <em>directly</em> infect.
							Generally, if <m>r_0 \gt 1</m>, we expect the disease to spread. 
							If <m>r_0 \lt 1</m>, we expect it to die out.

			<title>Graph Theory and Human Trafficking</title>
			
				<section>
					<title>April 6-10: Introduction to Graphs</title>
					
					
					<p>
						Our last unit of this course will focus on how we can use the power of mathematical modeling to love our neighbors.
						Specifically, we'll explore the mathematics of <em>networks</em>. 
						We'll spend the first two weeks working on developing the mathematical framework necessary to understand networks, and the remaining two weeks using our newfound understanding to explore the problem of human trafficking by studying transportation networks.
					</p>
					



						
						<p>
							You've almost certainly encountered the word <em>graph</em> in a math class.
						</p>
						
						<principle>
							<statement>
								<p>
									What is meant by the word <em>graph</em> in a mathematical context?
									Give as many answers as you can, and be as clear and precise as possible.
								</p>
							</statement>
						</principle>
						
						<p>
							A relatively new (by mathematical standards) use of the word <em>graph</em> in mathematics involves the notion of connection.
							It is this notion that we will be exploring in this unit.
							We present a formal definition below.
						</p>
						
						<definition>
							<p>
								A <term>graph</term>, <m>G</m>, is a collection of <term>vertices</term> (or <term>nodes</term>), <m>V</m>, and a collection of edges, <m>E</m>, which are pairs of vertices.
								We denote the graph as <m>G(V,E)</m>.
							</p>
						</definition>
						
						<p>
							This relatively simple, short definition nonetheless has deep consequences.
							We'll see an example below, but note that the primary defining features of a graph <m>G</m> are some objects (vertices) and the connections between (some of) the objects (the edges).
							If a vertex <m>v</m> is connected to another vertex <m>u</m> by an edge <m>vu</m>, we say <m>uv</m> is <term>incident</term> to <m>v</m>, and we say <m>u</m> is <term>adjacent</term> to <m>v</m> and is in the <term>neighborhood</term> of <m>v</m>.

						</p>
						
						<example>
							<p>
								As a straightforward initial example, consider the graph <m>G(V, E)</m> where <m>V = \{a,b,c,d\}</m> and <m>E = \{ab,ac,bd\}</m>.
								This graph has four vertices, and three edges.
								One <term>representation</term> (drawing) of it is given in <xref ref="fig-graphexample1" />.
								
								<figure xml:id="fig-graphexample1">
			
				<caption>One (bad) drawing of <m>G</m>.</caption>

				<image xml:id="img-graphexample1" width="50%" source="images/graph01.png" />
		</figure>
		
		As stated above, the most important feature of a graph is the connections it describes.
		Thus, we would say the graph in <xref ref="fig-graphexample2" /> <em>also</em> represents the graph <m>G</m> from <xref ref="fig-graphexample1" />.
		
		<figure xml:id="fig-graphexample2">
			
				<caption>Another (bad) drawing of <m>G</m>.</caption>

				<image xml:id="img-graphexample2" width="50%" source="images/graph02.png" />
		</figure>
		
		</p>
		</example>
		
		<activity>
			<statement>
				<p>
					In this activity, your job is to invent a graph <m>G</m> with the following properties.
					Draw it on paper, take a photo of it, and upload the photo as your response.
					Then explain why your example meets the given criteria (e.g., for Question 4, which vertex has at least three neighbors?).
				</p>


				<ol>
					<li>Your graph should have six vertices</li>
					<li>Your graph should have ten edges</li>
					<li>There should be at least one pair of vertices between which you cannot trace a path of edges</li>
					<li>One vertex should should have at least three others in its neighborhood</li>
				</ol>

			</statement>
		</activity>
		
		<exploration>
		
			<statement>
				<p>
					We saw in the last unit that we could model changing quantities over time using discrete dynamical systems.
					Graphs, on the other hand, describe connections between objects.
					Brainstorm or research at least two or three complex, real-world situations which graphs might be helpful to model.
					That is, can you think of at least two or three situations in which one of the fundamental properties is <em>connection</em>?
					Briefly describe each situation in 3-4 sentences, and make clear how graphs can be used to describe these situations.
					If you find examples of such graphs, include those in your discussion board post.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</exploration>
		
		
		<p>
			In order to discuss the nuances of the connections modeled by a graph, we need a bit more terminology.
		</p>
		
		<definition xml:id="def-deg">
			<p>
				Let <m>G(V,E)</m> be a graph.
				A vertex <m>v</m> in <m>V</m> is <term>isolated</term> if it has no neighbors.
				The number of edges incident to a vertex <m>v</m> is known as the <term>degree</term> of <m>v</m>, denoted <m>\deg(v)</m>.
				If between every pair of vertices in <m>V</m> there is a path of edges, we say <m>G</m> is <term>connected</term>.

				</ol>
			</statement>
		</exploration>


		<p>
			Next time, we'll explore the underlying structure of connectedness in graphs in more depth.
			In particular, we'll search for minimal (in terms of numbers of edges) subgraphs called <em>trees</em> to help us see which edges are most important.

					<title>April 13-17: Trees</title>
					

<p>
				Two fundamental questions in the analysis of graphs are: given two vertices, is there a path between them? And if so, how can we find the shortest possible path?
				Let's consider the second question first.
				</p>

				<p>
				Notice in the graph in <xref ref="fig-graphexample3" /> that there are several paths between, say, <m>a</m> and <m>f</m>.
				There is a path spanning two edges: <m>a \to c \to f</m>.
				There is also a path spanning four edges: <m>a\to c \to d \to e \to f</m>.
				In general, by the <term>distance</term> between two vertices, we mean a path consisting of the fewest edges possible, so the distance between <m>a</m> and <m>f</m> is 1.
			</p>
			
			<activity>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Consider the graph in <xref ref="fig-distance" />.

					<li>Find three paths from vertex <m>L</m> to vertex <m>E</m>.</li>
					<li>Determine the distance from vertex <m>B</m> to vertex <m>N</m>. How many paths of this distance can you find?</li>
				</ol>


				</statement>

			</activity>

			
			<p>
				Returning to the first question above, if the graph is connected, the answer is obviously <em>yes</em>.
				So, given a graph <m>G(V,E)</m>, we are often interested in removing superfluous edges in a systematic way to arrive at a smallest (which will be made precise shortly) connected <term>subgraph</term> <m>T(V,E')</m>.
			</p>
			
			
			<definition>
				<p>
					A <term>cycle</term> on <m>n</m> vertices <m>v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n</m> is the graph with <m>n+1</m> edges <m>v_1 v_2, v_2 v_3, \ldots, v_{n-1} v_n, v_n v_1</m>.
					We denote such a cycle by <m>C_n</m>.
					That is, a cycle consists of a path <m>v_1 \to v_2 \to v_3 \to \ldots \to v_n \to v_1</m>, where the only repeated vertex is the first/last one.
				</p>
			</definition>

			<example>
				<video youtube="iu-Zm4xBYw4" />
			</example>
			
			<p>
				One of the major questions in theoretical graph theory is: given a graph <m>G</m>, is there an algorithm that determines whether <m>G</m> contains any cycles?
				There are several such algorithms, and they are relatively efficient.
				A related question is: given a graph <m>G</m>, is there an efficient algorithm which can produce a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once? 
				The answer to this question is currently unknown (as of April 2020), but an active area of research. <aside>This is known as a <term>Hamiltonian cycle</term>.</aside>
			</p>

			<p>
				Our focus for the rest of this section is graphs that do <em>not</em> contain any cycles.

			<definition xml:id="def-tree">

					A connected graph <m>T(V,E)</m> that does not contain any cycles is known as a <term>tree</term>.

				The description given in <xref ref="def-tree" /> is pretty close to what we want.
				Given a graph <m>G(V,E)</m>, we want a tree <m>T(V,E')</m> such that every vertex of <m>G</m> is also a vertex of <m>T</m>, and every edge of <m>T</m> to be an edge of <m>G</m>.
				Such a tree is known as a <term>spanning tree</term> for <m>G</m>.

				The last big idea that we need is the notion of a <m>weighted</m> graph, which we introduce with an example.

					Consider the graph in <xref ref="fig-conveyorbelt" />.
					Suppose the vertices represent stations in a factory, and the edges represent conveyor belts between the stations.

				<p>
					A manager in the factory may be interested in how efficiently the conveyor belts can be run.
					Suppose that belt <m>cd</m> costs $11/day to run, belt <m>de</m> costs $8/day to run, belt <m>cf</m> costs $9/day to run, belt <m>df</m> costs $12/day to run, and belt <m>ef</m> costs $11/day to run.
					We can represent this by labeling each edge with its cost, as seen in <xref ref="fig-weightedbelt" />.

				<p>
					This is an example of a <term>weighted graph</term>, which is just a graph with the edges labeled.
					The labels usually represent something meaningful about the problem.
					For example, we could have weighted the edges in <xref ref="fig-weightedbelt" /> with the time it takes to move an object from one station to another, or the distance between stations (as one might find on a map), etc.
				</p>


			</example>
			
			<p>
				We tie this all together with the concept of a <term>minimal spanning tree</term>, which is a spanning tree with the smallest total weight.
			</p>
			
			<example xml:id="ex-mwst-elimination">
				<p>
					Again, consider the weighted graph representing our conveyor belt in <xref ref="fig-weightedbelt" />.
					The total cost to run the belts for one day is $51. Assume that eliminating a belt does not substantially increase the cost of running the others. How could we find a lower-cost arrangement?
				</p>

			</example>
			
			<p>
				There are several algorithms for finding minimum weight spanning trees in addition to the one presented in <xref ref="ex-mwst-elimination" />.
				A famous such example is <term>Prim's algorithm</term>.

				In the remaining series of tasks, you will explore these techniques in the context of a basic communication network, which will prepare us for exploring human trafficking.

						<li>Let's assume that maximizing the number of interactions will minimize the amount of time it takes for everyone to receive the message.

					<title>April 20-27: Graph Theory and Human Trafficking</title>
					
					<p>
						In this section, we'll introduce no new mathematics.
						As you may have noticed, accurate data on trafficking is sparse and often unreliable, so we use mathematics to determine the most likely hubs of human trafficking, and highway maps to explore how trafficked individuals may be moved about the country.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						The activities in this unit are a bit longer and more open-ended than some we've done.
						To share the workload, there are jobs for up to four people in each group, named as persons A-D.
						Note that person D's tasks are optional, as you do not all have four group members.
						Ensure that you identify your role early in the week so that you can be available to chime in when you need to.
						</p>

					
					<exploration xml:id="expl-airlinehubs">
						<statement>
							<p>
								According to most recent UNDOC reports, most human trafficking victims to the United States originated from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia.
								In order to see how they are likely arriving, we'll need some flight maps.
								
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Locate the flight (route) maps for airlines as follows. <em>Person A:</em> 1 United States airline, 1 Latin American (not Mexican or Caribbean) airline, 1 Caribbean airline; <em>Person B:</em> 1 United States airline (different from Person A's), 1 Mexican airline, and 1 Asian airline. Clearly state your airlines, which country they originate from, and provide a link (or upload) to their route maps.</li>
								<li>Persons A and B: You may have noticed that the flight maps have the appearance of graphs, with the edges representing a particular flight segment, and the vertices the cities between which the planes fly. <em>For each airline you found</em>, list the top 10 U.S. cities they fly to, ordered by (vertex) degree (see <xref ref="def-deg" />). Make sure to state the degree of each city (and count flights between U.S. cities as well).</li>
								<li>Person D: record observations about the route maps and lists of cities and their degrees. Are there overlaps in the lists? Are the high-degree cities connected?</li>
								<li>Person C: If a city appears in multiple lists from Question 2, add its degrees from the various lists together (e.g., if Seattle has degree 7 in one list, degree 10 in another, and degree 15 in a third, its new total degree is <m>7+10+15 = 32</m>). Use these sums of degrees to determine the top 4 hubs for the transportation of people into the United States. What do you notice about the hubs? Are they in similar regions of the United States? Are any cities hubs for multiple countries (refer to the route maps from Question 1)?</li>
							</ol>
						</statement>
					</exploration>
					
					
					<p>
						Once trafficked people are in the country, they are generally moved via interstates and highways.
						In the next activity, we'll explore the major road system connecting one of your hubs to the surrounding region.
					</p>

					<exploration>
						<statement>
							<p>
								For this exploration, we'll use only the cities and roads identified on <url href="https://www.onlineatlas.us/interstate-highways.htm">this map</url> of the 48 contiguous United States.
								You can use <url href="https://maps.google.com">Google Maps</url> to calculate distances.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li><p>Person C: <em>Make sure you understand completely what you are being asked to do before you start!</em> Choose one of your group's hubs identified in <xref ref="expl-airlinehubs" />. Identify at least six other states nearby that hub's state; start with neighboring states, and expand to their neighbors until you have at least six states in addition to the state with the airline hub (feel free to do more). Then create a graph as follows.</p>
								<p>
									Each state is a single vertex. You should thus have at least 7 vertices.</p>
									<p>Let edges represent major highways (or combinations of major highways) that can be used to travel between states. There will likely be multiple edges connecting states! All travel will be between cities large enough to be listed on the <url href="https://www.onlineatlas.us/interstate-highways.htm">map</url>. Assign weights to be the approximate mileage to travel between the states via the specified routes as found on Google Maps. For example, the <url href="https://www.onlineatlas.us/interstate-highways.htm">map</url> shows that you can take Highway 5 to travel between Portland, OR, and Olympia, WA. This means there is an edge between OR and WA with weight 114 miles. However, you can also travel between Portland, OR, and Spokane, WA using Highways 84 and 90. This will add another edge to your graph with different mileage. (Since to move from, say, Washington to Montana requires travel through Idaho, and the distances are additive, we only need to consider routes between adjacent states.)</p>
								</li>
								<li>Person B: Create a minimal spanning tree for your map using the elimination algorithm identified in <xref ref="ex-mwst-elimination" />. Assuming that traffickers only use major highways when transporting people, the minimal spanning minimizes the number of miles to each city. What are the major highways of importance? What states in your region are the most significant? Do the cities with the highest degree remain?</li>
								<li>Person A: Use Prim's algorithm (recall <xref ref="alg-prim" />) to create a minimal spanning tree. Compare this to your previous spanning tree.
								</li>
								<li>Person D: Summarize the results of the previous two questions. What are the major hubs in each state? Note that you need to think carefully about which route each edge represents.</li>
							</ol>
						</statement>
					</exploration>
