		  <title>Introduction</title>
		  <p>
			In January 2017, Dr. Francis E. Su, president of the Mathematical Association of America, gave his retiring presidential address, <em><url href="https://mathyawp.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/mathematics-for-human-flourishing/">Mathematics for Human Flourishing</url></em><fn>In 2018, he gave an expanded version of this talk as a First Mondays address at Dordt College.</fn>. In this address and the subsequent book <xref ref="Su2020" />, Su describes ways that the practice of mathematics can help human beings cultivate virtues which in turn enable us live the good life. He identifies several desires that encourage the cultivation of virtue, among them <em>exploration</em>, <em>play</em>, <em>truth</em>, <em>justice</em>, and <em>beauty</em>.
		  </p>
  
		  <p>
			This book uses guided exploration to investigate mathematical topics that specifically meet those desires. We will explore the Rubik's cube and other puzzles and thus <em>play</em> with mathematics. We'll see how deductive reasoning can be used to argue for <em>truth</em>, while also exploring its limitations. <em>Justice</em> will be explored by application of mathematics to democracy and the networks used to exploit our fellow image-bearers. And we'll finish the semester with projects that explore <em>beauty</em> in mathematics.

		  <title>A Note to Students</title>
		  <p>
			This work was compiled with some strong opinions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The first is that, as with a sport, instrument, or nearly any other skill, you can't learn mathematics without doing mathematics. Thus, there are few worked-out examples in this book. We would rather spend a long time in productive struggle to understand an idea deeply than be spoon-fed solutions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The second is that most people's ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are far too narrow. Mathematics is not merely geometry, algebra, and calculus (maybe with a dash of statistics for good measure). Mathematics is a way of thinking; it's about abstraction, deductive reasoning, and problem-solving. This way of thinking can be applied in surprising places, and can lead to delight and wonder at the world God has made. We will explore some of these questions this semester.

		<title>Play</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				One of the fundamental human desires is for <em>play</em>.
				In recent years, ancient games and puzzles such as Go, Nim, and Chess have given way to a slew of <url href="http://boardgamegeek.com">new games</url>, many of which can be understood and analyzed with mathematical thinking.
			
				In this part, we explore play in the context of the classic Rubik's cube puzzle.
				Our exploration of the Rubik's cube is heavily inspired by the <url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org">Art of Mathematics</url> project.

					<p>
					<statement>
						Here are some questions we'll consider.
						<ol>
							<li>Who are you? Why are we here, together, in this class?</li>
							<li>What does it mean to play? To explore? We'll answer both in our major disciplines and in the discipline of mathematics.</li>
							<li>What are some of the superficial qualities of a Rubik's cube? What do you notice? What do you wonder?</li>

					Today we start with introductions to the course. Dr. Janssen introduced himself and gave an overview of the course (see the <url href="https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/">the syllabus</url> for more!), and then we worked on <xref ref="expl_intro" />.
				</p>
				</introduction>
			
				<exploration xml:id="expl_intro">
					<p>
						<statement>
							First, introduce yourself to the members of your group. Then, consider the questions:
							<ol>
								<li>What are the essential qualities of play? That is, what makes one activity <em>play</em>, and another not?</li> 
								<li>What does it mean to be <em>playful</em> in your own major disciplines?</li>
								<li>What does it mean to be an <em>explorer</em> in your major disciplines?</li>
								<li>What are you excited about this semester? Your answer can be from one of your classes or outside of your classes.</li>
							</ol>
							<!-- Write your answers in your notes. We'll discuss your responses before working on <xref ref="firstquestionsaboutthecube" />. -->
						</statement>
					</p>
					<!-- <solution>
						We only really had time to discuss the first two questions. There were some common themes.
						
						<ol>
							<li>Play: is enjoyable; is fair; will depend on the person; involves actively engaging with body/brain; is voluntary; can be strategic; is a leisure activity; is hands-on.</li>
							<li>In our major disciplines, playfulness: involves hands-on activities; creativity with lesson plans; uses manipulatives; allows us to play with/try on ideas (thought experiments); is social (involves relationship building); explore mathematical/physicals ideas; is a mindset; must engage the whole person; involves puzzles; etc.</li>
							<li>We didn't have time to talk about our answers to this question.</li>
							<li>Things we're excited about: getting into more of our major courses, continuing to learn, making new friends/growing together with old friends, and others.</li>
							
						</ol>
						One answer to question 1 that didn't come up is that an activity is often called play when there are no great stakes in the outcome. We can try to solve the Cube, play chess with our friends, or even play a basketball game, and in the end, it's just play. If it's competitive, it doesn't really matter whether we win or lose, and if it's a puzzle we're playing with of our own volition, the stakes are probably even lower.

				<statement>
					Here are some questions we'll consider.
					<ol>
						<li>What are the components of a Cube?</li>
						<li>What are some of the elementary mathematical properties of the Cube?</li>

				<p>
					The Rubik's cube<fn>We'll call it the Cube for short.</fn> was invented in 1974 by Erno Rubik, a Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture. It won the <em>Spiel de Jahres</em> (the German game of the year) in 1980, and it became one of the best-selling toys of all time. It's a great place to begin our exploration of mathematical play. 
				</p>
				
				
				
				
			
				<investigation xml:id="invest-firstquestionsaboutthecube">
					<statement>
						<p>
							In your groups, investigate your Cubes. What do you notice? What do you wonder? Make a list of as many observations and questions as you can, and write them in your notes.
						</p>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
							We noticed several things: there are six sides, and six colors. It seems that the white center is opposite the yellow, the blue center is opposite the green, and the red center is opposite the orange.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The main thing we wondered is: why does this exist? Why did Erno Rubik invent it? One person suggested that, well, it's a puzzle. And like we talked about last time, humans have this innate desire for play and creativity that was placed there by God. While some people might find the Cube a fun puzzle to play with, others might prefer a different sort of puzzle or game.
						</p>
					</solution>

				</investigation>
			
			
				<activity>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Just by turning the sides of the Cube, there are over 43 quintillion different configurations possible. <aside>43,252,003,274,489,856,000 to be exact.</aside>
							This is a nigh unimaginably large number.
							Brainstorm as many ways as you can (at least two!) to make this number concrete. 
						</p>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
							A popular approach involved covering the earth with a carpet of 43 quintillion objects. The estimates were that 43 quintillion pennies would carpet the earth 86 times, while 43 quintillion Rubik's cubes would blanket the earth 275 times. Another group estimated that 43 quintillion seconds is over a trillion years.

						 Either way, it's huge!

						The little cubes which make up the Cube are often called <term>cubies</term>. The cubies located at the corners are imaginatively called <term>corner cubies</term>, the cubies located at the centers <term>center cubies</term>, and the others <term>edge cubies</term>.

						In this investigation we'll consider the corner cubies. Hold your Cube with the white center cubie facing up and the red center cubie facing you.

<image xml:id="moving-corner-cubies" width="50%" source="./images/moving_cubies.svg" />
				</statement>
				<solution>
					There are 8 corners, with three stickers each. Since all corners have three stickers, and other cubies have fewer stickers, we can't move a corner cubie to any location other than another corner. But we <em>can</em> move a given corner to any other corner.
				</solution>

			<investigation xml:id="invest-edge-cubies">

				<solution>
					There are twelve edge cubies, with two stickers each. As was the case with corners, we can only put edge cubies in other edge locations, but we can move a given edge cubie to any other edge.
				</solution>

			<investigation xml:id="invest-center-cubies">
				<statement>
					<p>
						In this investigation we'll consider the center cubies. Hold your Cube with the white center cubie facing up and the red center cubie facing you.

<image xml:id="moving-center-cubies" width="50%" source="./images/moving_cubies.svg" />

					Finally, we saw that the six corners (each with one sticker) cannot move relative to the others.

			  <assemblage>
				  <title>Question</title>
				  <p>
					  <statement>
						  How can you tell when a cubie is in the correct <em>location</em>? How can you tell when it is <em>oriented</em> correctly? Is there a difference?<fn>Does it depend on the cubie?</fn>
					  </statement>

				  </p>
				<solution>
					Since the centers don't move relative to one another, we can use the centers to tell us where a given cubie goes. For instance, the corner cubie at the corner of the white, red, and blue faces must have a white, red and blue sticker. It is properly oriented when the correct sticker is in each face.

							<li>What is the order of a move?</li>

				<introduction>
					  <p>
						  Today, we'll get up to speed on how far everyone has come in solving their white (top) faces and layers. 
						  We'll be particularly interested in how you talk about/describe your methods. 
						  Then we'll see how the Cubing community has taken to writing and notating methods for systematically describing the motion of the Cube.
					</p>
	
				</introduction>
				
				<principle>
					<p>
						Find a partner. Take turns describing verbally <em>and without pointing to your Cube</em> your method for moving a corner cubie into its proper position. Similarly, verbally describe your method for moving an edge cubie into its proper position.
					</p>
					<!-- <solution>
						<p>
							We identified a few strategies for moving corner cubies to the correct location. If the cubie in question was already in the correct layer and the only thing we cared about was putting it in the correct location, we could just turn the appropriate layer until it was in the correct position.
						</p>
						<p>
							If it wasn't in the correct layer, we can orient the Cube and perform a rotation or two so the correct position for the cubie is the top right and the cubie in question is in the bottom left position. We then turn the right layer toward us, rotate the bottom layer so that the correct cubie is now in the front bottom right, and then turn the right layer away from us so that it is now in the correct location.
						</p>
	
						<p>
							We can also guess and check. <m>\ddot\smile</m>
						</p>
	
					</solution> -->
	
				</principle>
	
				
				<principle>
					<statement>
						As you probably noticed, it is challenging to orally describe complex/technical ideas in much detail<aside>A former professor of mine often threw up her hands at the idea of doing "math in the air".</aside>.
						
						Is it easier to describe your cubie movements in writing? Why or why not?
					</statement>
				</principle>
				
				<definition>
					<p>
						When the Cube is oriented so the white side is up and the red side is facing you, as in <xref ref="fig-standard-orientation" />, we will say it is in <term>standard orientation</term>.
					</p>
				</definition>
				
				<figure xml:id="fig-standard-orientation">
				
					<caption>A cube in standard orientation.</caption>
	
					<image xml:id="cube-faces" width="50%" source="./images/cube_faces.svg" />
			</figure>
	
				<convention>
					<p>
						The standard algebraic notation for moving the faces of the Cube is as follows: <m>F, R, L, U, D</m>, and <m>B</m> refer to clockwise quarter-turns (<m>90^\circ</m> rotations) of the front, right, left, up, down, and back faces, respectively, <em>as you look at the face in question</em>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						On the other hand, a <m>-1</m> superscript indicates a counterclockwise turn <em>as you look at the face in question</em>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Finally, we can string moves together by writing them left to right, such as <m>R F U L D</m>. If we want to repeat a move, we use exponents in the usual way, such as <m>R F^2 U (LD)^3</m>.
					</p>
	
				</convention>
				
				<exploration>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Rather than refer to the faces of the Cube by their orientation, we could have referred to them by color. Compare and contrast the color naming scheme to the orientation naming scheme. What advantages/disadvantages do each present?
						</p>
	
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
							We had a few thoughts. First, not every Cube has the standard coloring that ours do.
							Second, some people are colorblind, so referring to the faces by color would not be helpful.
							In short, every Cube has six sides and an orientation when you hold it in front of you that makes it easy to identify the up, down, back, front, left, and right faces. So that is what the Cubing community has adopted.
						</p>
	
					</solution>
	
	
				</exploration>
	
				
				<p>
					A final concept we'll explore today is that of <em>order</em>.
				</p>
	
				
				<definition>
					<p>
						The <term>order</term> of a sequence of moves <m>M</m> is the least positive number of times <m>n</m> that <m>M</m> can be repeated before your Cube is back where it started. We write <m>| M | = n</m>.
					</p>
	
				</definition>
	
				<example>
					<p>
						The order of <m>R</m> is 4, since 4 quarter-turns will put my right face back where it started, and no smaller postive number of turns will.
					</p>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						In order to solve the Cube, we need to figure out how to move cubies in carefully controlled ways. Starting in this section, we'll introduce one move at a time and make sure we understand exactly what it does before moving on.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a warning, be aware that what follows might be occasionally frustrating. That's ok! As we saw last time, the order in which moves are executed does matter, so one mistake will throw everything off. You may want to designate one member of the group as the Cube turner, and let the others carefully track the moving cubies.

					<title>Conclusion</title>
					
					<p>
						Today we explored the last move we need to solve the Cube. 
						We also described a strategy for solving the Cube<fn>Note that when you complete your Rubik's Cube MFA, you can use whatever strategy you want, but you will be asked to demonstrate competence on two of the four moves we explored (randomly chosen at the time of the MFA).</fn>. 
						Our method of solving the Cube is based on the <em>corners-first</em> (CF) method, which is distinct from the layer-by-layer (LL) method which is often the first solving method people learn. The first solution to the Cube, by Erno Rubik himself, was corners-first, and the first world speed-cubing record (22.95 seconds) was done corners-first.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are advantages and disadvantages to all methods.
						Advantages to corners-first are:
						<ul>
							<li>The move sequences are generally shorter in CF</li>
							<li>There are just a few important move sequences to memorize</li>
							<li>You generally don't "break" your existing work and so can recover from mistakes more easily</li>
							<li>The solution can scale from a leisurely solve of a few minutes or more to quite fast solves</li>

				<title>Truth</title>
				
				<introduction>
					<p>
						Throughout scripture, Christians are exhorted in various ways and to various activities regarding <em>truth</em>.
						We are told that knowledge of "the truth" will "set [us] free"<fn>John 8:32</fn>, Christ calls Himself "the way, the truth, and the life"<fn>John 14:6</fn>, and says that his mission is to testify to the truth<fn>John 18:37; to which Pilate asks: "What is truth?"</fn>. Further, Paul exhorts believers to think on "whatever is true"<fn>Phil. 4:8</fn>.
						But what <em>is</em> truth? Can mathematics help us better apprehend and understand it?
					</p>
		
						<p>
							Mathematics is often thought of as one of the last bastions of objective truth.
							One widely accepted cultural norm is that if a statement is quantitative, or can be arrived at via a sequence of logical deductions, it is often considered "true", whereas statements that cannot be presented in such a way live in the realm of opinion. But what do mathematicians mean when they talk of a statement being "true"? The answer might surprise you.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							In this unit, we'll explore inductive and deductive reasoning, as well as formal logic. We'll explore the shortcomings of mathematical thinking in addition to its strengths.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							This chapter is heavily influenced by <em><url href="https://www.artofmathematics.org/books/truth-reasoning-certainty-and-proof">Discovering the Art of Mathematics: Truth, Reasoning, Certainty, and Proof</url></em> by Fleron, Hotchkiss, Ecke, and von Renesse.

						<!-- <solution>
							<p>
								<em>Truth</em> refers to propositions which are correct and valid for all time, places, and people. It never changes. <em>Facts</em> refer to propositions supported by evidence. They are subject to change based on new evidence.
								There was some debate about the nature of truth relative to belief. 
								For instances, Christians believe that the historical person of Jesus is the Son of God. 
								Muslims do not. 
								Is this statement true for Christians but not for Muslims?
								Or is the proposition that the historical person of Jesus is the Son of God <em>true</em>, but Christians and Muslims have differing beliefs on its truth?

						<title>What's my world?</title>
						<statement>
							<p>
								In the game <em>What's my World?</em>, one person thinks of a single law that defines a hypothetical world (e.g., <q>My world does not contain things that start with the letter 'C'.</q>). The other players attempt to guess this governing law by taking turns asking questions of the creator, such as <q>Does your world contain dogs? Does it contain cats?</q> and so on. When one of the guessers believe they can identify the governing law, they ask the creator.
							</p>

							<p>
								We played various rounds of this game, but the only way we identified that we could know <em>for certain</em> that we had guessed the governing law correctly is by asking the creator. We can amass evidence and develop facts and a theory based on those facts, but we can only know for certain by asking the creator directly.

						The work of the guesser in <xref ref="act-whats-my-world" /> is to employ inductive reasoning to determine the general law put in place by the creator.
						This is the scientific process at its best: looking at the creation its orderliness and our creatureliness to infer larger governing principles.

					<title>Feb. 10: Statements and Logical Connectives</title>
					
					<activity>
						<statement>
							<p>
								What are the strengths and weaknesses of inductive reasoning?
								Brainstorm as many as you can.
								What could you do to minimize the effect(s) of the weaknesses?
							</p>
	
						</statement>
						
	 
	<solution>
							<p>
								The main weakness of inductive reasoning is that no matter how many data points you gather for your theory, it is possible to find another data point which blows it all up.
							</p>
							<p>
								The strengths are that it's easy to get started. You just gather data and study it. More data generally indicates stronger evidence for your conclusions. It also applies in realms in which pure deduction via axioms does not work.
							</p>
	
						</solution>
	
	
	
					</activity>
	
					
					
					
					
					<p>
						Mathematical reasoning is generally deductive<fn>Though we have our own <url href="https://ringswithinquiry.org/SubSec-WellOrdering.html">special version of induction.</url></fn> (defined momentarily), and begins with <term>axioms</term>, which are statements that should be self-evident and taken to be true.
					</p>
					
					<investigation>
						<statement>
						<p>
							The most famous set of axioms are Euclid's postulates for geometry, defined in <em><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid's_Elements">The Elements</url></em>, which not only shaped thousands of years of geometry, but solidified the deductive approach to doing and explaining mathematics that we will explore in this unit.
							At the beginning of Book I of <em>The Elements</em>, Euclid identified five postulates and five axioms.
						</p>
						<p>
							Euclid's <em>postulates</em> are:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.</li>
							<li>Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.</li>
							<li>Any circle can be described given a center and (radial) distance.</li>
							<li>All right angles are equal to one another.</li>
							<li>If a straight line intersecting two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on the side on which the angles are less than two right angles.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>
							Euclid's <em>axioms</em> (or <em>common notions</em>) are:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.</li>
							<li>If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.</li>
							<li>If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.</li>
							<li>Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.</li>
							<li>The whole is greater than the part.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>
							The desired qualities of a system of axioms are:
						</p>
							<ol>	
								<li><term>consistency</term>: we cannot deduce contradictory propositions, such as "God exists" and "God does not exist" from the same set of axioms</li>
								<li><term>simplicity</term>: we have as few axioms as possible, and they are no more complicated than they need to be</li>
								<li><term>completeness</term>: the system can answer every question we can think to ask</li>
							</ol>
	
						
	
	
						<p>
							In your groups, discuss Euclid's postulates and common notions, perhaps in view of the desired qualities of an axiomatic system.
							What strikes you as being interesting or noteworthy? Make a list of at least 2-3 observations.
							Then consider: on what axioms or assumptions do you make decisions (e.g., about how to spend your time, resources, etc)?
						</p>
						</statement>
						
						<solution>
							<p>
								Axioms are unproved, self-evident propositions on top of which logical deductions can be made, and entire fields of study rest.
								They should be as simple as possible; all except Euclid's fifth postulate (the parallel postulate) are considered quite straightforward.
								The parallel postulate has a fascinating history; it turns out be independent of the other postulates, and one can create new geometries (on the surface of a sphere, for instance), by rejecting it.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are lots of unproved assumptions that we make in life.
								Many Christian mathematicians make explicit that they view the authority of Scripture as an axiom; they can't use logic to conclusively deduce that Scripture is the only authority for Christian faith and life, but they <em>assume</em> it in order to draw conclusions <em>about</em> faith and life.

						</solution>
	
	
	
	
	
					</investigation>
					
					
	
					<p>
						The process of <term>deductive reasoning</term> in mathematics begins from a set of generally agreed-upon axioms of <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory">set theory</url><fn>It should be noted that there is disagreement about the Axiom of Choice, mostly due to some of its surprising consequences.</fn> and uses logic to make inevitable conclusions from those axioms. These conclusions are generally called <term>theorems</term>. They are usually given as conditional statements of the form "If <m>P</m>, then <m>Q</m>," where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are sensible<aside>Up to some definition of the word "sensible".</aside> statements.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The author Lewis Carroll loved logic puzzles (he was actually a mathematics professor!), and wrote many of them. Here is one, axiomatized for easy reference.
					</p>
	
					
					<axiom xml:id="axiom-kittens">
						<title>(Carroll)</title>
						<statement>
							<p>
								Consider the axioms:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>If a kitten loves fish, then it is teachable.</li>
								<li>Every kitten without a tail will play with a gorilla.</li>
								<li>All kittens with whiskers love fish.</li>
								<li>If a kitten has green eyes, then it is not teachable.</li>
								<li>All kittens have whiskers or do not have tails.</li>
							</ol>
							
						</statement>
					</axiom>
					
					<p>
						Now, prove the theorems that follow using <xref ref="axiom-kittens" />.
					</p>
	
					
					<theorem>
						<statement>
							<p>
								All kittens with whiskers are teachable.
							</p>
						</statement>
						<proof>
							<p>
								Suppose we have a kitten with whiskers. Let's call him Arthur. By <xref ref="axiom-kittens" /> #3, Arthur loves fish. Since Arthur loves fish, <xref ref="axiom-kittens" /> #1 implies that Arthur is teachable.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Therefore, all kittens with whiskers are teachable.
							</p>
	
	
						</proof>
	
					</theorem>
					
					
					<theorem>
						<statement>
							<p>
								If a kitten has green eyes, then it does not love fish.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</theorem>
					
					<theorem>
						<statement>
							<p>
								If a kitten has a tail, then it does not have green eyes.
							</p>
						</statement>
						<proof>
							<p>
								TBD! We tried some things, but there are issues. We'll look at it again after we study <xref ref="def-implications" />.
							</p>
	
						</proof>
	
					</theorem>
					
					<theorem>
						<statement>
							<p>
								Every kitten with green eyes will play with a gorilla.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</theorem>
					
					
	
					
					<activity>

								Invent one or two additional theorems that can be deduced from <xref ref="axiom-kittens" />.
								Prove them.

					<title>Feb. 12: The Resistance</title>
					
					
					
					
					<p>
						Today, we continue exploring logical/deductive reasoning. We'll first do it in the context of a game and related puzzles<fn>The puzzles are courtesy of <url href="https://www.taylor.edu/employees/faculty/derek-thompson">Derek Thompson</url> of Taylor University.</fn>.
						Given time, we'll start setting the stage for what became known as the <em>foundational crisis of mathematics</em>.
					</p>
					
					<subsection>
						<title>The Resistance</title>
						
						<p>
							To set the stage for a few puzzles, we'll play the social deduction game, <em><url href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance">The Resistance</url></em>.
							If you've ever played Werewolf or Mafia, this won't be too much of a stretch.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Resistance is set in a futuristic world where Rebels are trying to overthrow a sinister government, but Spies have invaded The Resistance.
							The Spies know who the other Spies are, but the Rebels don't know who anyone is.
							In the game, 5-10 players will pick teams to go on 5 <q>missions</q>.
							The Rebels win if three missions are successful.
							The Spies are trying to be put on the missions in order to sabotage them.
							If three missions are unsuccessful, the Spies win.
						</p>
						
						<subsubsection>
							<title>Setting up a mission</title>
							
							<p>
								At the beginning of the game, the Spies reveal themselves to each other, while the Rebels know no one's identity but their own.
								A leader is then nominated, who proposes a team to go on a mission (the teams vary in size from round to round).
								The group votes simultaneously and openly about whether to approve the proposed team for the mission.
								If the team is rejected, leadership is passed clockwise; otherwise, the team goes on the mission.
								If five teams are rejected in the same round, the Spies win <em>the entire game</em> automatically.
							</p>
						
						</subsubsection>
						
						<subsubsection>
							<title>Going on a mission</title>
							
							<p>
								There is nothing to <em>do</em> on a mission; each participant simply decides whether the mission <em>Succeeds</em> or <em>Fails</em> by playing the appropriate card.
								Rebels <em>must</em> play a Pass card; Spies may choose either card.
								If <em>any</em> card is a Fail card, the mission fails (unless playing with 7+, in which case two Fail cards are required).
								Players are free to say whatever they like, whether it is true or false.
								However, players may <em>not</em> reveal their identity card that indicates if they are a Spy or a Rebel.
							</p>
						
						</subsubsection>
						
						<subsubsection>
							<title>Playing the Game</title>
							
							<example>
								<statement>
									<p>
										Two people, Amanda and Bob, are elected to go on a mission.
										One Pass card is played, while one Fail card is played.
										
										If Amanda is a Rebel, what can we (validly) conclude about Bob? Is this sound?
									</p>
								</statement>
							</example>
							
							<p>
								Now, let's get into groups and play! Remember:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Leader proposes a team for the mission.</li>
								<li> Everyone votes whether or not to accept the team for the mission.</li>
								<li>If the mission is not accepted, leadership rotates and the new leader proposes a team.</li>
								<li>If the mission is a go, those on the mission vote for it to succeed or fail.</li>
								<li>Rebels win if three missions succeed; Spies win if three fail or five consecutive teams are not accepted for the mission.</li>
								<li>Once you get the hang of the structure, try to think strategically and logically about the choices you're presented.</li>
							</ol>

											We have seen thus far a way of formalizing logic so that we can think about the truth of a statement purely syntactically (structurally) without regard for the semantic meaning of the statements under consideration.
											In the late 19th century, mathematicians developed what became known as <term>formal systems</term>, consisting of axioms, which were strings of symbols, such as
											<me>
												\exists B \forall C, (C\in B \Leftrightarrow C\subseteq A),
											</me>
											along with a <term>logical calculus</term>, which govern the rules of inference that can be used on the axioms to deduce new theorems.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											Further, mathematicians had long assumed there were consistent foundational axioms for their discipline.
											Newly discovered paradoxes challenged this view.
										</p>
										<exploration>
											<title>Russell's Paradox</title>
											<p>
												In a certain town lives a barber who only cuts the hair of <em>all</em> people who do not cut their own hair.
												Who cuts the barber's hair?
											</p>
											<solution>
												<p>
													This is a paradox: if the barber cuts his own hair, we reach a contradiction, as he only cuts the hair of those who do not cut their own hair. On the other hand, if the barber does not cut his own hair, he does by definition.
												</p>
												<p>
													This sort of self-referential paradox is exactly the sort that we'll study later in this section that led to the foundational crisis referred to in the section title.
												</p>
											</solution>

										<p>
											Two main schools of mathematical philosophy sprung up in the wake of these discoveries.
											The <term>formalists</term> argued that statements of mathematics and logic are really just about the rules and consequences for manipulating symbols and strings of letters.
											That is, mathematics does not have a subject matter at all--just empty symbols, which may be given an interpretation in particular situations and thus have meaning.
										</p>
										<p>
											The response came from the <term>intuitionists</term>.
											Intuitionism is an approach that consideres mathematics to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of any principles which we can reasonably claim exist in an objective reality.
											Thus, in some sense, mathematics is up to whoever is doing the mathematics.
											To the intuitionists, the formalists were reducing mathematics to a meaningless game with symbols.
										</p>
										
										<principle>
											<p>
												Do you resonate more with a formalist approach to mathematics, or an intuitionist approach?
												Relatedly: do you believe mathematics is something humans invent, or something we discover in the creation?
												Why?
											</p>
										</principle>
						
						
										<p>
											In 1900, at the second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, the esteemed mathematician David Hilbert posed 23 theretofore unanswered problems in mathematics that he thought were important to guide the development of mathematics in the 20th century.
											We've already seen one of them (the 8th): the Goldbach conjecture.
											Most of Hilbert's problems have been solved, but three are unresolved, two are thought to be too vague to ever get consensus on what a solution would look like, and one is the subject of much debate.
										</p>
										<p>					
											In an attempt to resolve the issues raised by paradoxes like Russell's Paradox, Hilbert posed this problem, the second on the list:
										</p>
										<blockquote>
											But above all I wish to designate the following as the most important among the numerous questions which can be asked with regard to the axioms: To prove that they are not contradictory, that is, that a definite number of logical steps based upon them can never lead to contradictory results….
										</blockquote>
										
										<p>
											That is, Hilbert wanted mathematicians to prove that the axioms on which mathematics was founded did not lead to a contradiction.
											The resolution to this problem is surprising, and to begin to explore it, we will turn to the infinite.

						Today we carefully describe the fundamental aspects of matheamtical reasoning, beginning with a visit to Smullyan Island<fn>Named for American mathematician and logician, <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan">Raymond Smullyan</url>.</fn>.
						We'll then consider propositions and their truth values, as well as ways of combining elementary propositions into more complex propositions via logical connectives.
						One of the most important and subtle connectives is the conditional implication, described in <xref ref="def-implications" />.
					</p>
					
					
					<axiom xml:id="axiom-smullyan">
						<statement>
							Consider the axioms of Smullyan Island:
							<ol>
								<li>All citizens of Smullyan Island are either knights or knaves.</li>
								<li>Knights always tell the truth.</li>
								<li>Knaves always lie.</li>
							</ol>
						</statement>
					</axiom>
	
					<exploration>
						<statement>
							<p>
								You find yourself on Smullyan Island, talking to two citizens, Priyanka and Gretchen.
								Gretchen says, "We are both knaves."
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Can Gretchen be a knight? Explain.</li>
								<li>What can you conclude about the validity of Gretchen's statement? Explain.</li>
								<li>Deductively establish whether Priyanka is a knight or a knave.</li>
							</ol>
						</statement>
						<solution>
							<p>
								If Gretchen were a knight, she would be lying when she said "We are both knaves." Thus, she is a knave.
								Since she is a knave, her statement must be false, which means that they are not <em>both</em> knaves.
								Therefore, Priyanka is a knight.

					A hallmark of mathematical thinking and research is to abstract from a collection of examples to make a deeper structural conjecture, for which we then attempt to supply a deductive proof.
					As an example, consider <xref ref="expl-goldbach" />.
					We collected examples of a pattern (the equations) and suggested the conjecture that all even whole numbers greater than or equal to 6 can be written as the sum of two primes.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mathematicians began mathematize and formalize logic itself. Today we begin to explore these foundational issues. We'll start with some definitions.
				</p>
	
				
				<definition>
					<p>
						A <term>proposition</term> is a declarative sentence which is either true or false, but not both.
						An <term>elementary proposition</term> is a sentence with a subject and a verb, but no connectives (such as <em>and, or, not, if-then,</em> or <em>if-and-only-if</em>).
					</p>
	
				</definition>
				
				<activity xml:id="act-statements">
					<statement>
						<p>
							Determine which of the following are propositions (elementary or otherwise).
							If a given sentence is a statement, determine its truth value.
							If it isn't, explain why not.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Erik Hoekstra is the president of Dordt University.</li>
							<li>The square root of a whole number is always a whole number.</li>
							<li>The Green Bay Packers are the worst football team.</li>
							<li>Why is this class so much fun?</li>
							<li>This sentence is false.</li>
							<li>A group of crows is called a murder.</li>
							<li>Everyone likes cats.</li>
						</ol>
	
					</statement>
					
					<solution>
						<ol>
							<li>This is a true proposition.</li>
							<li>This is a false proposition. As an example, <m>\sqrt{21}</m> is not a whole number.</li>
							<li>This one is harder (though it's an easy "true" from your instructor). But it's likely either a false proposition (due to the Packers not having the worst record in the league) or not a proposition at all, as agreement with the sentence is a matter of subjective taste.</li>
							<li>This is an interrogative, not a declaration.</li>
							<li>This is a declarative sentence, but it's neither true nor false; it's a paradox.</li>
							<li>This is a true proposition! Who knew?</li>
							<li>This is a false proposition.</li>
						</ol>
	
					</solution>
	
	
				</activity>
				
				<p>
					Now that we have a sense for what a proposition is, we'll take old propositions and make new ones using logical connectives.
					In order to describe how the connectives work, mathematicians define the truth values of the new propositions <em>formally</em> in terms of the possible combinations of truth values from the constituent propositions.
					This gives us an abstract way of considering the truth values of propositions.

						Last time, we learned about the push from mathematicians in the late 19th/early 20th century were trying to show that the axioms, the very foundations on which mathematics was built, were both <em>complete</em> (the truth of every sensible statement could be decided via deductions from the axioms) and <em>consistent</em> (one could never deduce contradictory statements from the axioms).
					</p>
					
					<p>
						For reasons which are hopefully clear, we'll assume that the axioms are consistent, that is, no contradictions will arise from them. (If contradictions <em>can</em> arise, we are in trouble indeed.)

							In 1931, the Austrian mathematical logician Kurt Godel resolved Hilbert's question in an unexpected way in his two <term>incompleteness theorems</term>.
						</p>
						
						<theorem>
							<title>Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem</title>
							<statement>
								<p>
									Any sufficiently strong consistent formal system contains undecidable statements.
								</p>
							</statement>
						</theorem>
						
						<p>
							That is, there are sensible statements that one can make which cannot be proved from within the system. In that case, we may adopt the undecidable statement or its negation as an additional axiom without causing any contradiction.
							The statement suggested by <xref ref="discussion-undecidable" /> is just such an undecidable statement.
						</p>
						
						<theorem>
							<title>Godel's Second Incompleteness Theorem</title>
							<statement>
								<p>
									The consistency of a consistent system cannot be established within the system.
								</p>
							</statement>
						</theorem>
						
						<p>
							We thus obtain limitations on the formal axiomatic approach to mathematics. Any consistent set of axioms and rules of inference strong enough to include arithmetic must contain undecidable statements. Furthermore, no sufficiently strong formal system can establish its own consistency!
						</p>
						
						
						<principle>
							<statement>
								<p>
									Godel's theorems leave mathematicians and students of mathematics in a precarious state. Consider the following questions for discussion.

									<li>Godel's first theorem implies that that are mathematical  questions that do not have <q>one right answer</q>. What do you think of this when you consider the nature of mathematics and the ideas you've grown up with regarding what sort of discipline mathematics is?
									</li>
									<li>Godel's second theorem implies that the consistency of mathematics is taken as an article of faith. Yet our society seems to have an elevated role for quantitative arguments (e.g., how does one refute a statistic?). How can these theorems help us to think about the proper place of mathematics in society?</li>

					<p>
						This week, we start a unit on justice, and begin to consider ways in which mathematics can be used to build a more just society.
						Our first topic in this vein deals with representation in U.S. government.
						On Wednesday, we'll look at the idea of apportionment: given a number of seats in the U.S. House, how should they be doled out to states based on population?
						We'll consider multiple methods for doing so, as well as their consequences in the electoral college and for the process of drawing district lines in the states (though this won't come until next week).
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  	However, the week starts on Monday with our thematic checkpoint over our Truth unit, which will take the form of a 50-point exam.

					<title>Feb. 24: Reading Discussion II and Apportionment</title>
					
					
					<introduction>
						
						<p>
							Today we begin a short exploration of matheamtics and democracy. There are <em>lots</em> of different topics we could cover, but of special relevance to us this year is the notion of apportionment and the electoral college.
						</p>
						<p>
							Apportionment is the process by which the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are divided amongst the states. Every ten  years, following a census, Congress must pass a new apportionment bill. They will do so this year. A state's apportionment in Congress is also directly tied to its power in the electoral college, so the electoral vote after the 2024 presidential election will likely look different than it did following the 2020 election.
						</p>
						<p>
							The states then go through a redistricting process, modifying the geographic areas represented by their House members based on the new apportionment and their new understanding of their population's geographic distribution. There has been a lot of talk in the political (and mathematical) news about <em>gerrymandering</em>, the process of drawing district lines to favor one group over another. Given time, we'll explore this as well.

							Interestingly, Hamilton's method, passed by Congress, was the subject of the first presidential veto.

							Unfortunately (though perhaps unsurprisingly), Congress did nothing. Perhaps they hoped the problem wouldn't happen again.
							But then it did, in the very next apportionment, in 1832.
							Further, it turns out that if Jefferson's method had continued to be used, something similar would have happened in every apportionment since 1852.
						</p>
						
						<principle>
							<statement>
								<p>
									An alternative to Jefferson's method was proposed by John Adams, except rather than rounding the quotas down, he rounded up.
									Explain why this is no better than Jefferson's method.
								</p>
							</statement>
						</principle>
						
						<definition>
							<statement>
								<p>
									The <term>quota rule</term> states that, in an apportionment, each state should be given a number of seats equal to its standard quota, rounded up or down<mdash />no more, no less.
									An apportionment method is said to <term>violate quota</term> if it can produce apportionments which fail the quota rule<aside>As Jefferson's method did with NY in 1822.</aside>
								</p>
							</statement>
						</definition>
						
						<p>
							So, both Jefferson's method and Adams' method violate quota.
							The method used in 1842 was due to Daniel Webster, and modifies Jefferson and Adams only slightly.
							Rather than rounding the quotas always up or always down, Webster proposed that they should be rounded conventionally (i.e., a decimal part less than 0.5 gets rounded down, while a decimal part at least 0.5 gets rounded up)
						</p>
						<p>
							It turns out that Webster's method can also violate quota, though this is much less likely. In fact, if Webster's method had been used in every apportionment from 1794 to 2012, it would not have violated quota once.
							As it happened, though, Webster's method was only used in 1842.
							Perhaps Congress was wary of continuing to use a method that could violate quota after 1822 and 1832.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 1850, Samuel Vinton proposed what turned out to be Hamilton's method all over again, though no one remembered it as such<fn>Who tells your story, indeed.</fn>
							It happens that Hamilton's method cannot violate quota (why?).
							It was used for the apportionments of 1852 and 1862, though by 1872, Congress illegally and unconstitutionally apportioned seats based on no method at all.
							This had consequences for the presidential election of 1876, where Hayes defeated Tilden based on the electoral college, whereas if Hamilton's method had been used in 1872, Tilden would have easily won.
						</p>
						<p>
							Congress went back to Hamilton's method in 1882, but not for long.
							Next time we'll look at some paradoxes that can arise from the apportionment process.
