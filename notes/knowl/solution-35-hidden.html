<li>Raymond is normal.</li>
<li>That the native told the truth.</li>
<li>Since Raymond is consistent, he cannot both believe the native is a knight, and not believe that the native is a knight. So, he cannot believe the native's statement.</li>
<li>If he believes the native is a knave, he will not believe the native's statement. Thus, he does not believe that he will never believe the native is a knight. That is, he believes he will believe that the native is a knight, and since he is stable, he believes the native is a knight.</li>
<li>Since Raymond is consistent, he can't both believe the native is a knave and not believe the native is a knave. Thus, he cannot believe the native is a knave.</li>
<li>When Raymond believes the native is a knight, he eventually believes he is not a knight, which is a contradiction. Similarly if Raymond believes the native is a knave. Thus, he cannot ever believe either, as he is consistent.</li>
<li>The native is a native of the Island, and so, if the rules of the island are to be believed, must be a knight or a knave.</li>
