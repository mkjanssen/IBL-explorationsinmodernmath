<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose Raymond believes he is incapable of making a mistake, and he meets a native who says, "You will never believe that I am a knight."</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Suppose Raymond begins with the case that the native is a knave. What can he conclude from the native's statement?</li>
<li>Based on your answer to the previous question and the fact that Raymond thinks he is incapable of making mistakes, what does he conclude the native to be? Explain.</li>
<li>Explain why your answer to the previous question gives rise to a contradiction.</li>
<li>What does your answer to Questions 2-3 mean about Raymond's assumption that the native is a knave? Explain.</li>
<li>Based on your reasoning thus far, what does Raymond now believe the native to be?</li>
<li>Based on the native's statement, "You will never believe I am a knight," what is the true status of the native? Explain.</li>
<li>Based on your answers to this exploration, explain why a reasoner who believes they are accurate and who meets a native who says, "You will never believe that I am a knight" will eventually become inaccurate.</li>
