<ol class="decimal">
<li>Suppose that Raymond believes the native is a knight. Explain why it is reasonable to conclude that that Raymond believes that he believes the native is a knight.</li>
<li>Since Raymond believes that the native is a knight, what must he also believe, based on what the native said? Explain.</li>
<li>Explain why your answers to Questions 1-2 show that Raymond will thus never actually believe the native is a knight since he is consistent.</li>
<li>Alternatively, suppose that Raymond at some point believes that the native is a knave. What must he also believe, based on what the native said? Explain</li>
<li>Explain why your answers to questions 4-5 show that Raymond will thus never actually believe the native is a knave since he is consistent.</li>
<li>Use your answers to questions 1-6 to explain why Raymond will never believe that the native is a knight nor that this native is a knave.</li>
<li>Explain why, despite your answer to the previous question, we know that the native must be either a knight or a knave.</li>
