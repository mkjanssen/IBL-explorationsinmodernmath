<span class="type">Question</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">2.0.9</span><span class="period">.</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="title">How will each item of work be assessed?</span>
</h6>
<p>Unlike "typical" college courses, there are no points or partial credit to be earned in this course. Instead, each item of work will come with its own <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">specifications</dfn> for completing the item at one of four potential levels, each of which is given an approximate interpretation below:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">E</em>xceeds expectations: this work is submitted on time, is extremely well done, clearly communicated, and could function as the official class solution.</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">M</em>eets expectations: this work is generally correct, but either contains some minor mathematical errors which do not detract from the overall solution, or contains some unclear/incomplete communication.</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">R</em>evision needed: the work contains some significant errors and/or the guidelines for preparing and presenting the solution were not followed, but you seem to be on the right track toward a passing grade.</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">N</em>ot assessable: the work was not turned in on time, is difficult to read, or contains significant enough flaws that you're probably better starting over.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Generally, E's and M's are considered <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">passing</em>, while R's and N's are not. Some assessments will be graded on a 2-level rubric (such as group presentations), some on a 3-level (such as the Rubik's cube quiz), and others on a 4-level (such as the other MFA's).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chapter-2.html#question-9">in-context</a></span>
