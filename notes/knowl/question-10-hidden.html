<ul class="disc">
<li>Group work presentations will be graded on an M/N scale; if you have something productive to say, each member of your group will get an M, and if not, each will get an X. You may not revise presentations which are not assessable. There is no limit to the number of times your group can be selected to present, so you can accumulate the number of successful presentations in line with your goal by repeatedly volunteering to present.</li>
<li>The journals will be graded on an M/R/N scale. You may cash in a token for either a 24-hour extension (and may stack tokens to obtain 48-hour extensions, etc.) or revise a journal which was assessed at an R or X in order to obtain an M.</li>
<li>The Rubik's cube MFA can be attempted up to twice/week starting on January 27, without penalty, until you achieve the grade you are aiming for.</li>
<li>Details on other MFAs are forthcoming, but you may use tokens to revise and resubmit each MFA.</li>
