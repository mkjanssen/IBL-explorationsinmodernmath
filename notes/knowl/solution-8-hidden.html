<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We identified a few strategies for moving corner cubies to the correct location. If the cubie in question was already in the correct layer and the only thing we cared about was putting it in the correct location, we could just turn the appropriate layer until it was in the correct position.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If it wasn't in the correct layer, we can orient the Cube and perform a rotation or two so the correct position for the cubie is the top right and the cubie in question is in the bottom left position. We then turn the right layer toward us, rotate the bottom layer so that the correct cubie is now in the front bottom right, and then turn the right layer away from us so that it is now in the correct location.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We can also guess and check. \(\ddot\smile\)</p>
