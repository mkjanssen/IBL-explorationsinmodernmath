<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Consider the following proposed voting system, using <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table-bcprez.html" title="Table 5.2.6: Preference schedule for the presidency of The Bluth Company.">TableÂ 5.2.6</a> as the preference schedule.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Step 1: First, we'll ask voters to choose between George and Lindsay. Since this is a two-candidate election, we'll use majority rule to decide the winner.</li>
<li>Step 2: Next, we'll ask the voters to choose between Buster and the winner from Step 1, again using majority rule to decide the winner.</li>
<li>Step 3: Finally, we'll ask the voters to choose between Michael and the winner from Step 2. Whoever wins this third head-to-head contest will be declared the overall winner.</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Consider the method described above.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Under this method, who wins the presidency of the Bluth Company?</li>
<li>Under this method, what societal preference order is produced?</li>
<li>In light of the plurality and Borda count results for this election, does anything about your answers to Questions 1 and 2 strike you as being strange or unusual? Explain.</li>
<li>Is there a Condorcet winner and/or loser in this election? Explain.</li>
</ol>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The method described above is known as <dfn class="terminology">sequential pairwise voting</dfn>. What strikes you as being different or unusual about it, especially compared to the plurality and Borda count systems we've already explored?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-13.html#expl-spv">in-context</a></span>
