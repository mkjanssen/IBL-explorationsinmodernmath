<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Our main focus of study in what follows is the statement "You will never believe that I am a knight," made by a native of Smullyan Island<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-17-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.4.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>. In order to draw appropriate conclusions, we will need to be outside the system, so we will consider a reasoner named Raymond as he interacts with natives on Smullyan Island. We will first deal with a Raymond who believes he is incapable of making a mistake; that is, if Raymond believes a particular statement, then, as far as he is concerned, the statement is really true. For example, if Raymond ever believes that a native is a knight, then because he thinks he is incapable of making mistakes, he concludes that the native really is a night and therefore that everything that person says is true.</p>
