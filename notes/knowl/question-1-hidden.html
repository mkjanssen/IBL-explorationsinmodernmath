<body><article class="question example-like"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Mathematics is about the numerical, spatial, and logical aspects of God's creation. However, most people have a view of the content and form of mathematics that is limited to their K-12 courses. In content, many view mathematics as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and maybe trigonometry, all pointing toward calculus. In form, many view mathematics as a discipline in which the questions all have one right answer, possibly only one correct path to a solution, with new ideas presented as if handed down from Mount Sinai. We'll see this semester that both of these ideas are flawed. Mathematics is really about a way of looking at a question, and reasoning toward a solution. It's a way of doing this, as Francis Su suggests, that helps meet basic human desires and can ultimately cultivate <em class="emphasis">shalom</em> in its practitioners.</p></article></body>
