<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Consider an election with \(N\) candidates. The <dfn class="terminology">Borda count</dfn> works as follows. Each voter submits a ballot that contains their entire preference order for all candidates in the election. For each ballot cast, points are awarded to each candidate according to the following rules:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>A last-place vote is worth 1 point.</li>
<li>A second-to-last-place vote is worth 2 points.</li>
<li>\(\displaystyle \vdots\)</li>
<li>A third-place vote is worth \(N-2\) points.</li>
<li>A second-place vote is worth \(N-1\) points.</li>
<li>A first-place vote is worth \(N\) points.</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The candidate who accumulates the largest number of total points from all of the ballots is declared the winner, and the societal preference order is determined by listing the candidates in order of the number of points they received, largest to smallest. In the event that two or more candidates are tied with the largest number of points, they are all declared winners (or some suitable prearranged tiebreaking procedure is used).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-12.html#definition-15">in-context</a></span>
