<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In fact, many political scientists believe that Ralph Nader was a <em class="emphasis">spoiler candidate</em> for Gore in 2000; that is, they believe that a large percentage of the Nader voters likely would have voted for Gore if Nader had not been on the ballot. Moreover, since Florida was the deciding factor in the election (we'll talk more about the electoral college later), the razor-thin margin of 537 votes (0.009% of the popular vote in Florida) swung the election from Gore to Bush. In this section, we'll explore the wrinkles introduced by additional candidates, and develop alternative systems for choosing winners of elections.</p>
