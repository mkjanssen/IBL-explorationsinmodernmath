<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">According to most recent UNDOC reports, most human trafficking victims to the United States originated from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia. In order to see how they are likely arriving, we'll need some flight maps.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Locate the flight (route) maps for airlines as follows. <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Person A:</em> 1 United States airline, 1 Latin American (not Mexican or Caribbean) airline, 1 Caribbean airline; <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Person B:</em> 1 United States airline (different from Person A's), 1 Mexican airline, and 1 Asian airline. Clearly state your airlines, which country they originate from, and provide a link (or upload) to their route maps.</li>
<li>Persons A and B: You may have noticed that the flight maps have the appearance of graphs, with the edges representing a particular flight segment, and the vertices the cities between which the planes fly. <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">For each airline you found</em>, list the top 10 U.S. cities they fly to, ordered by (vertex) degree (see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-deg.html" title="Definition 7.1.6">DefinitionÂ 7.1.6</a>). Make sure to state the degree of each city (and count flights between U.S. cities as well).</li>
<li>Person D: record observations about the route maps and lists of cities and their degrees. Are there overlaps in the lists? Are the high-degree cities connected?</li>
<li>Person C: If a city appears in multiple lists from Question 2, add its degrees from the various lists together (e.g., if Seattle has degree 7 in one list, degree 10 in another, and degree 15 in a third, its new total degree is \(7+10+15 = 32\)). Use these sums of degrees to determine the top 4 hubs for the transportation of people into the United States. What do you notice about the hubs? Are they in similar regions of the United States? Are any cities hubs for multiple countries (refer to the route maps from Question 1)?</li>
