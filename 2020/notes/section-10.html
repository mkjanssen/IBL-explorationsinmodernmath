</h2>
<p id="p-161">We have seen thus far a way of formalizing logic so that we can think about the truth of a statement purely syntactically (structurally) without regard for the semantic meaning of the statements under consideration. In the late 19th century, mathematicians developed what became known as <dfn class="terminology">formal systems</dfn>, consisting of axioms, which were strings of symbols, such as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\exists B \forall C, (C\in B \Leftrightarrow C\subseteq A),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">along with a <dfn class="terminology">logical calculus</dfn>, which govern the rules of inference that can be used on the axioms to deduce new theorems.</p>
<p id="p-162">Further, mathematicians had long assumed there were consistent foundational axioms for their discipline. Newly discovered paradoxes challenged this view.</p>

<p id="p-163">In a certain town lives a barber who only cuts the hair of <em class="emphasis">all</em> people who do not cut their own hair. Who cuts the barber's hair?</p>

<p id="p-164">This is a paradox: if the barber cuts his own hair, we reach a contradiction, as he only cuts the hair of those who do not cut their own hair. On the other hand, if the barber does not cut his own hair, he does by definition.</p>
<p id="p-165">This sort of self-referential paradox is exactly the sort that we'll study later in this section that led to the foundational crisis referred to in the section title.</p>
</div></div></article><p id="p-166">Two main schools of mathematical philosophy sprung up in the wake of these discoveries. The <dfn class="terminology">formalists</dfn> argued that statements of mathematics and logic are really just about the rules and consequences for manipulating symbols and strings of letters. That is, mathematics does not have a subject matter at all--just empty symbols, which may be given an interpretation in particular situations and thus have meaning.</p>
<p id="p-167">The response came from the <dfn class="terminology">intuitionists</dfn>. Intuitionism is an approach that consideres mathematics to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of any principles which we can reasonably claim exist in an objective reality. Thus, in some sense, mathematics is up to whoever is doing the mathematics. To the intuitionists, the formalists were reducing mathematics to a meaningless game with symbols.</p>

<p id="p-168">Do you resonate more with a formalist approach to mathematics, or an intuitionist approach? Relatedly: do you believe mathematics is something humans invent, or something we discover in the creation? Why?</p></article><p id="p-169">In 1900, at the second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, the esteemed mathematician David Hilbert posed 23 theretofore unanswered problems in mathematics that he thought were important to guide the development of mathematics in the 20th century. We've already seen one of them (the 8th): the Goldbach conjecture. Most of Hilbert's problems have been solved, but three are unresolved, two are thought to be too vague to ever get consensus on what a solution would look like, and one is the subject of much debate.</p>
<p id="p-170">In an attempt to resolve the issues raised by paradoxes like Russell's Paradox, Hilbert posed this problem, the second on the list:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="blockquote-1">But above all I wish to designate the following as the most important among the numerous questions which can be asked with regard to the axioms: To prove that they are not contradictory, that is, that a definite number of logical steps based upon them can never lead to contradictory results….</blockquote>
<p id="p-171">That is, Hilbert wanted mathematicians to prove that the axioms on which mathematics was founded did not lead to a contradiction. The resolution to this problem is surprising, and to begin to explore it, we will return to Smullyan Island. Recall <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/axiom-smullyan.html" title="Axiom 4.3.4">Axiom 4.3.4</a>.</p>

In order to draw appropriate conclusions, we will need to be outside the system, so we will consider a reasoner named Raymond as he interacts with natives on Smullyan Island. We will first deal with a Raymond who believes he is incapable of making a mistake; that is, if Raymond believes a particular statement, then, as far as he is concerned, the statement is really true. For example, if Raymond ever believes that a native is a knight, then because he thinks he is incapable of making mistakes, he concludes that the native really is a night and therefore that everything that person says is true.</p>
