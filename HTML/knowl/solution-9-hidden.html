<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We had a few thoughts. First, not every Cube has the standard coloring that ours do. Second, some people are colorblind, so referring to the faces by color would not be helpful. In short, every Cube has six sides and an orientation when you hold it in front of you that makes it easy to identify the up, down, back, front, left, and right faces. So that is what the Cubing community has adopted.</p></div></body>
