<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let edges represent major highways (or combinations of major highways) that can be used to travel between states. There will likely be multiple edges connecting states! All travel will be between cities large enough to be listed on the <a class="external" href="https://www.onlineatlas.us/interstate-highways.htm" target="_blank">map</a>. Assign weights to be the approximate mileage to travel between the states via the specified routes as found on Google Maps. For example, the <a class="external" href="https://www.onlineatlas.us/interstate-highways.htm" target="_blank">map</a> shows that you can take Highway 5 to travel between Portland, OR, and Olympia, WA. This means there is an edge between OR and WA with weight 114 miles. However, you can also travel between Portland, OR, and Spokane, WA using Highways 84 and 90. This will add another edge to your graph with different mileage. (Since to move from, say, Washington to Montana requires travel through Idaho, and the distances are additive, we only need to consider routes between adjacent states.)</p>
