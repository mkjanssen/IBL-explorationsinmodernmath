<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We may begin by supposing Corrie is a knave<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-16-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. In that case, her statement is false, and there must be 0 or 2 knights. But if Corrie is a knave, there cannot be 2 knights, so there must be 0 knights, in which case Will's statement is false. However, this leads us to the conclusion that Corrie is a knight, yet we began by assuming that she is a knave.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This contradiction forces us to conclude that Corrie is a knight, and her statement implies that she is the only knight. Thus, Will is a knave.</p>
