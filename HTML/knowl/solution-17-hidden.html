<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="emphasis">Truth</em> refers to propositions which are correct and valid for all time, places, and people. It never changes. <em class="emphasis">Facts</em> refer to propositions supported by evidence. They are subject to change based on new evidence. There was some debate about the nature of truth relative to belief. For instances, Christians believe that the historical person of Jesus is the Son of God. Muslims do not. Is this statement true for Christians but not for Muslims? Or is the proposition that the historical person of Jesus is the Son of God <em class="emphasis">true</em>, but Christians and Muslims have differing beliefs on its truth?</p></div></body>
