<body><article class="question example-like"><p>That depends! On a superficial level, this course fulfills several requirements. If you haven't taken a quantitative reasoning course, this course fulfills that core requirement. Or maybe you are seeking a middle school math endorsement; this course is required for that. Regardless of why you are in this course, I have several hopes for you.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>I hope you have fun! I think mathematics is delightful, and not as dry or boring as is often presented, and I hope you get to experience that this semester.</li>
<li>I hope you experience both authentic, active struggle with new mathematical ideas and questions, as well as the immense satisfaction from working out a solution.</li>
<li>I hope your ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are expanded. We can think mathematically about almost anything, from games and puzzles to philosophy, truth, justice, and beauty. We'll explore these ideas while also acknowledging their limitations.</li>
<li>On a related note, I hope you ask lots of questions!</li>
<li>Finally, I hope you see the practice of mathematics as a form of fulfilling the cultural mandate. Even when we work to solve the Rubik's cube, we are inquiring into God's creation, exploring the hidden order and potential built into the fabric of the cosmos by an almighty God.</li>
