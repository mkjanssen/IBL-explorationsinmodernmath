<li>If Raymond believes the native is a knight, he will believe what the native tells him.</li>
<li>Let \(P\) be the statement "I (the native) am a knight". Then Raymond believes \(P\text{,}\) which means he believes the native's statement, which is that he does not believe \(P\text{.}\) This is a contradiction, as Raymond is regular.</li>
<li>He now believes the native is a knave.</li>
<li>Raymond believes the native's statement is false.</li>
<li>Since Raymond believes the native's statement is false, he does not believe that he will never believe the native is a knight. Thus, he does not believe that he believes that the native is a knave.</li>
<li>No. In either case he begins by believing the native is one thing, and eventually believes that he does not believe it.</li>
