<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="alert">Dordt University COVID-19 Policy:</em> Dordt University is committed to developing a community of Christian scholars where all members accept the responsibility of practicing personal and academic integrity in obedience to biblical teaching. For students, this means not lying, cheating, or stealing othersâ€™ work to gain academic advantage; it also means opposing academic dishonesty. Students found to be academically dishonest will receive academic sanctions from their professor (from a failing grade on the particular academic task to a failing grade in the course) and will be reported to the Student Life Committee for possible institutional sanctions (from a warning to dismissal from the university). Appeals in such matters will be handled by the student disciplinary process. For more information, see the <a class="external" href="http://www.dordt.edu/campus_life/student_handbook/general_information.shtml#academic_integrity" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>.</p>
