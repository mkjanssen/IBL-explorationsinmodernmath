<p>That's a really tough question. Given the exploratory/inquiry-oriented nature of the course, I can't really say what we'll be doing on a given day all that far ahead of time. However, I think it will look something like this:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Module 1 (Play):</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, these notes will hopefully be a useful tool for seeing what is coming up, as well as what you miss when you (unfortunately) have to be absent.</p>
