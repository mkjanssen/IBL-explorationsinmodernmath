<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For this exploration, we'll use only the cities and roads identified on <a class="external" href="https://www.onlineatlas.us/interstate-highways.htm" target="_blank">this map</a> of the 48 contiguous United States. You can use <a class="external" href="https://maps.google.com" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> to calculate distances.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Person C: <em class="emphasis">Make sure you understand completely what you are being asked to do before you start!</em> Choose one of your group's hubs identified in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/expl-airlinehubs.html" title="Exploration 7.3.1">Exploration 7.3.1</a>. Identify at least six other states nearby that hub's state; start with neighboring states, and expand to their neighbors until you have at least six states in addition to the state with the airline hub (feel free to do more). Then create a graph as follows.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Each state is a single vertex. You should thus have at least 7 vertices.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let edges represent major highways (or combinations of major highways) that can be used to travel between states. There will likely be multiple edges connecting states! All travel will be between cities large enough to be listed on the <a class="external" href="https://www.onlineatlas.us/interstate-highways.htm" target="_blank">map</a>. Assign weights to be the approximate mileage to travel between the states via the specified routes as found on Google Maps. For example, the <a class="external" href="https://www.onlineatlas.us/interstate-highways.htm" target="_blank">map</a> shows that you can take Highway 5 to travel between Portland, OR, and Olympia, WA. This means there is an edge between OR and WA with weight 114 miles. However, you can also travel between Portland, OR, and Spokane, WA using Highways 84 and 90. This will add another edge to your graph with different mileage. (Since to move from, say, Washington to Montana requires travel through Idaho, and the distances are additive, we only need to consider routes between adjacent states.)</p>
</li>
<li>Person B: Create a minimal spanning tree for your map using the elimination algorithm identified in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-mwst-elimination.html" title="Example 7.2.12">Example 7.2.12</a>. Assuming that traffickers only use major highways when transporting people, the minimal spanning minimizes the number of miles to each city. What are the major highways of importance? What states in your region are the most significant? Do the cities with the highest degree remain?</li>
<li>Person A: Use Prim's algorithm (recall <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/alg-prim.html" title="Algorithm 7.2.13: Prim's Algorithm">Algorithm 7.2.13</a>) to create a minimal spanning tree. Compare this to your previous spanning tree.</li>
<li>Person D: Summarize the results of the previous two questions. What are the major hubs in each state? Note that you need to think carefully about which route each edge represents.</li>
