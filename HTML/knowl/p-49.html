<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Due to Dr. Janssen's travel, we won't meet again until Monday, January 20. Your goals for then are to spend at least six hours working to solve the white face several times so that you can articulate a strategy. Ideally, your strategy will be clear enough that you could hand it to a friend who knows nothing about the Cube and they could follow your instructions to solve it. If you accomplish this, try to do the same for the white layer. If you don't accomplish it, that's okay! We'll get there!</p>
