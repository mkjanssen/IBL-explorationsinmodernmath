<body><article class="question example-like"> Tokens are a fake currency which you can use to break the rules of the class. You'll start the semester with five (5) tokens. You <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">may</em> have the opportunity to earn more, but this is not guaranteed. Tokens left over at the end of the semester are absorbed into the spacetime continuum and do you no good. In general, you may use tokens to: <ul class="disc">
<li>earn a 24-hour extension on assignments with due dates. Tokens may be stacked to earn 48-hour extensions, 72-hour extensions, etc.;</li>
<li>revise a journal or MFA (other than the Rubik's cube MFA, which comes with two free attempts/week from January 27 until the last day of classes);</li>
<li>do other things, as announced (and updated here).</li>
</ul></article></body>
