		<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>

				<title>Questions about the course content</title>
			
				<question>
					<title>What is this course <em>about</em>?</title>				
					<p>
						Mathematics is about the numerical, spatial, and logical aspects of God's creation. However, most people have a view of the content and form of mathematics that is limited to their K-12 courses.
					
						In content, many view mathematics as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and maybe trigonometry, all pointing toward calculus. In form, many view mathematics as a discipline in which the questions all have one right answer, possibly only one correct path to a solution, with new ideas presented, as if handed down from Mount Sinai, by an expert teacher.
					
						We'll see this semester that both of these ideas are flawed. Mathematics is really about a way of thinking, a way of looking at a question, and reasoning toward a solution. It's not the only way to think about these problems, but

					<title>What are the course learning objectives?</title>

				<question>
					<title>But seriously: what is this course <em>about</em>?</title>
				
					<p>
					
					</p>
				</question>
			
				<question>
					<title>What will we be doing on March 23 (other than celebrating Dr. Janssen's birthday)? In other words, what is the course schedule?</title>
					<p>
						That's a really tough question. Given the exploratory/inquiry-oriented nature of the course, I can't really say what we'll be doing on a given day all that far ahead of time. However, I think it will look something like this:
					
						<ul>
							<li> Module 1 (Play): </li>
							<li> etc </li>
						</ul>
					
						Also, these notes will hopefully be a useful tool for seeing what is coming up, as well as what you miss when you (unfortunately) have to be absent.
					</p>
				</question>
			
				<question>
					<title>But what am <em>I</em> supposed to get out of this course?</title>
					<p>
						That depends! 
					
						On a superficial level, this course fulfills several requirements. If you haven't taken a quantitative reasoning course, this course fulfills that core requirement. Or maybe you are seeking a middle school math endorsement; this course is required for that.
					
						Regardless of why you are in this course, I have several hopes for you.
						<ul>
							<li>I hope you have fun! I think mathematics is delightful, and not as dry or boring as is often presented, and I hope you get to experience that this semester.</li>
							<li>I hope you experience both authentic, active struggle with new mathematical ideas and questions, as well as the immense satisfaction from working out a solution.</li>
							<li>I hope your ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are expanded. We can think mathematically about almost anything, from games and puzzles to philosophy, truth, justice, and beauty. We'll explore these ideas while also acknowledging their limitations.</li>
							<li>On a related note, I hope you ask lots of questions!</li>
							<li>Finally, I hope you see the practice of mathematics as a form of fulfilling the cultural mandate. Even when we work to solve the Rubik's cube, we are inquiring into God's creation, exploring the hidden order and potential built into the fabric of the cosmos by an almighty God.</li>

				<title>Questions about the course structure</title>
		
		
			<question>
				<title>What will we do on a typical day?</title>			
				<p>
					Each day will be an exploration, in groups of 2-3, of a sequence of mathematical tasks. We'll typically start by wrapping up any loose ends from the previous day, then move on to the new tasks for the day. We'll take the last ten minutes or so to present our responses to the day's tasks and discuss where to go next.

				<title>How will we be assessed?</title>
				
					<question>
						<title>What items of work will be assessed?</title>
						<p>
							As described elsewhere, the course will be broken into four modules, plus the final project.
							For each module, there will be:
						
								<ul>
									<li> some journal assignments</li>
									<li> group (in-class) work</li>
									<li> a module final assessment (MFA)</li>
								</ul>
							 The nature of the MFA will differ from module to module and authentically and summatively assess your mastery of that module's content. 
					
							In lieu of a final exam, you'll do a final project exploring some mathematical topic that you deem beautiful and present during our final exam slot, which is <alert>3:30pm on Wednesday, May 8</alert>.

						<title>How will my final grade be computed?</title>

							In general, your final grade will correspond to the highest row which has been <em>fully satisfied</em> in <xref ref="finalgradetable" />:
