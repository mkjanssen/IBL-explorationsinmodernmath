## Course Information

* **Course**: Math 149-01 (3 cr.)
* **Term**: Spring 2021
* **Instructor**: Dr. Mike Janssen, Associate Professor of Mathematics
* **Classroom**: CL 2241
* **Class time**: 1:00-1:50pm MWF
* **Office**: SB 1612
* **Student Hours**: [Make an appointment](https://bit.ly/BookProfJanssen) or drop by
* **Course notes**: [https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/notes/](https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/notes/) | [PreTeXt source](https://github.com/mkjanssen/IBL-explorationsinmodernmath)
* **Course website**: [https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/](https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/)
* **Catalog Course Description**: This course is focused on exploring college-level mathematics relevant for all students, regardless of discipline. We will investigate modern mathematical topics including number theory, modeling, fractals, infinity, probability, making meaning from data, and decision-making. Mathematical thinking, reasoning, and pattern discovery will be particularly emphasized. A guided discovery approach will be utilized, and we will discuss how a Reformed perspective impacts our view of the quantitative world. **Prerequisite**: an ACT mathematics score of 22 or higher or satisfactory completion of one course from Mathematics 100, 108, 115.

### Required resources

* Access to the [course notes](https://prof.mkjanssen.org/emm/notes)
* One 3x3 Rubik's cube (any cube will do, but [here is an inexpensive recommendation](https://www.amazon.com/CuberSpeed-JiaoShi-Meilong-stickerless-Classroom/dp/B07QHQYQ9F/ref=sr_1_5_mod_primary_new?dchild=1&keywords=3x3+cubing+classroom&qid=1606835769&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=8-5))
* A copy of [_Mathematics for Human Flourishing_](https://www.francissu.com/flourishing), by Francis Su


### Learning Objectives

* Students will play with God’s mathematical creation by solving a Rubik’s cube and other mathematical puzzles. (CS)
* Students will explore the notion of mathematical truth, and assess its place in understanding God’s creation. (RO, CR)
* Students will apply mathematical thinking to articulate a vision for a more just society. (CD, CR)
* Students will explore the power and limitations of mathematics for modeling the physical creation. (CS, CR)
* Students will identify, analyze, and present on a piece of beauty in mathematics. (RO, CS)

### Assignments

The best way to learn mathematics is to _do_ mathematics, and so we will regularly engage in the following items of work to
